"Manila, Philippines",5.0,"We came to Borobudur Temple accompanied by our driver from Yogyakarta. Came early in the morning after visiting Setumbu Hill. Before coming here, make sure you have a ticket to go up to the temple grounds to get the best experience, because if you only buy a temple ground ticket, you can only tour the temple grounds without guidance from a local guide. It's best to plan your trip carefully because Borobudur Temple is a destination that you must visit when you come to Indonesia.",2024-05-13,Family,2024-05,philippines,12.7503486,122.7312101

"Barcelona, Spain",4.0,"It is a beautiful temple, in a beautiful settings. If you go, make sure that you pay the extra money (IDR 450k) to go up into the temple. It would be pointless not to do so. The grounds are pretty, but by themselves they would not justify the trip. Now, was I over the moon with the visit? Not really. I think it is a nice thing to do if it fits your trip to Indonesia, but I would not suggest to make this the highlight of it, as there could be some disappointment.	In terms of booking arrangements, I booked with Klook, and everything worked fine. A private tour, leaving the hotel at 8, visiting Borobudur and Prambanan temple, and back by 4pm. Low effort, low profile, just good enough. Be advised that a lot of the ""cheaper"" quotes, including for Klook are prices for Indonesians. The cost when you are a foreigner is higher, and the tour will go quite up in price. Totally fair, in my view, but just something to be aware of.All in all, it is a great day out, and a beautiful temple.",2024-04-17,Couples,2024-04,spain,39.3260685,-4.8379791
"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"Went Borobudur before pandemic and was surprised now they changed the rules. They limit people to visit Borobudur in a day. Believe is to preserved the temple which is a good way (although they should started it since long time ago).When we just reach the temple, alot people will sell hat and you can even renting stroller (if you bring young kids!). Strongly suggest to bought ticket online. I didn’t know that now they limit the people to visit the temple so I couldn’t get the time I wanted (9.30am). They have few timing in a day which per time, they limit people to 150 max. Since I couldn’t get the timing I wanted & I had another appointment before 12pm, so I just bought the ticket until main ground+Ratu boko temple. So sad come all the while to Borobudur but can’t visit the main temple. The price for foreigner was so much different with the locals. Foreigner around USD 30, while locals only USD 7. But since Borobudur is famous worldwide, with or without foreigners, they already very popular even among local tourists. And you just need to suck it up. I bought tickets together with Ratu Boko and ticket valid for 2 days. Borobudur stil beautiful as before. There’s alot officers surrounding to make sure people without valid ticket won’t be able to enter the temple. But take note is very very very hot. Must drink alot water, wear hat & apply TONS of sunscreen. After you done visiting the temple you will need to have a big you turn & very long walk (need to passby those local sellers) before you can reach the parking area. Overall I will be back to Borobudur next time if I have the chance",2024-04-12,Family,2024-03,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992
"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"It was, of course, just as wonderful as all the pictures suggest. We were thrown by the somewhat unusual timings here: Sunup is around 5am. So get there very early if you don't want it to be too hot. We arrived at around 10am and it was already sweltering. Also, you have to take a guide selected by the site itself. So I imagine it's total pot-luck about who guides you up the stairs with your 'souvenir' shops. Talking of which, beware the markets around the outskirts of the site. The hawkers are aggressive.",2024-04-08,Family,2024-04,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992
"Cairns, Australia",4.0,"My wife and I recent visited Borobudur. We had a great time and here are a few tips I would have for foreigners planning a visit here.  - The site is partially closed on Mondays. This means you can get into the complex to see Borobudur but you cannot climb the temple which would be one of my main recommendations. - To get here from Yogyakarta you can hire a private driver (I believe this is about 500000 - 650000 for a day), take a grab or use the bus. The bus schedule should be attached to this review with the bus station that I took that photo at being located in front of the bank of Indonesia on the southern end of jalan malioboro road. We used a grab and it cost us 170000 one way. The driver was happy to wait around for us to finish and we paid him the same amount directly to go back. It took about an hour and 15 minutes to get there from Yogyakarta. - This is one of the most popular attractions in Indonesia and thus visitor numbers both foreign and domestic are significant. I would suggest coming early (opening time) both to combat this and the significant heat. They used to offer a sunrise tour but it’s unclear to me whether this is currently running. - There are two types of tickets and the one you select is very important - there is a ‘temple ground ticket’ that allows entry just into the temple park and temple yard (aka the area around the base of the temple). This costs 387500IR for foreigners and 50000IR for locals. The other ticket is the ‘temple structure’ ticket which allows the above as well as a guided tour to the top of Borobudur. This costs 455000IR for foreigners and 120000IR for locals. You absolutely want to get the temple structure ticket as a lot of the temples features - most notably its famous stupors (the bell looking structures with holes) aren’t visible from the base. In addition this tour includes a guide who provides some context to the structure which is helpful.- Visitor numbers for the temple structure ticket are capped. I believe it is 1200 people and this is divided over the course of the day. This means once 1200 people have booked this ticket you cannot get one. Alternatively if everyone has booked the 0830, 0930 and 1030 tours you may have to wait around until 1130 to do the tour, despite getting there at opening time. To combat this I would suggest booking online through the website. We did this in the car on the way to the temple once we got an idea of our ETA and it worked well. - There is a combination ticket for Borobudur and Prambanan. I would advise against this as this ticket only includes Borobudur temple ground ticket, not temple structure. - The guided tour take about an hour. The first 40 minutes is spent at the lower levels of the temple. The guide will run you through its history and the stories behind it. The final 20 minutes is spent at the top level and can only be described as a photo feeding frenzy. This is where the famous photos of Borobudur come from. It can be a bit tricky trying to take decent photos with everyone around but if you just wait they do clear. - The temple is very hot being exposed to the elements and also being made of stone. I would strongly suggest bringing a hat, sunscreen and water. It’s also one of the reasons I would advise you to come early. - You can’t wear shoes on the temple. Instead you are given a set of bamboo thongs (which I believe you get to keep) and a bag to keep your shoes in. - You could visit this temple and prambanan on the same day but I would advise against it. It would be a long day and the heat of visiting prambanan would be terrible if you arrived in the afternoon.- On the lower levels of the temple really watch you step as there are not rails and someone looking at their phone could easily fall off the edge.- Your ticket affords entry to a museum which has information boards in English and Indonesian regarding Borobudur including its restoration Overall a great place to visit even if the ticket price is a bit predatory for foreigners.",2024-03-25,Couples,2024-03,australia,-24.7761086,134.755
"Sydney, Australia",5.0,"The opening hours of Borobodur have recently changed to protect it. On Mondays, you can only access the gardens around it. It also now has limited numbers of people allowed to climb the temple, about 1000 a day. You can book online through the government site. If you use a local Yogya tour guide, they'll be able to arrange your climb ticket. Borobodur is a couple of hours' drive from Yogyakarta, and a couple of hours' drive from Prambanan. They can be seen in the same day but it will require your own car/driver and good planning. Borobodur is beautiful and well worth the visit. They are very careful about maintaining their heritage listing so there is no development around it and it even limits what can happen in Yogyakarta itself. When you climb the temple, you have to wear the slippers they provide, which you then get to keep. They're quite good quality but a bit hard on your feet if you're not used to walking so far in what are effectively thongs/flip flops. Our guide spent quite a long time at the lower levels so it didn't feel like too much work climbing all the stairs as we only climbed one set at a time before having a good rest. He told us a huge amount about the history and construction and, by the time we reached the highest level, the other groups that started at the same time as us had already gone, giving us the top to ourselves, just 20-odd people. It was fabulous and very well-timed on his part. February is very hot and humid. You're given a small water bottle to climb with but most of group bought more water straight after the tour at the little stall at the base, near the exit. It's quite a long walk back to the carpark and you have to go through so many lanes of market stalls it seems never-ending.

If the price were more reasonable, I would give a bit better review but to travel all that way and pay $40 Australian, it was disappointing.  I would not recommend it and like alot of places I found on trip adviser, it’s not as good as it is made out to be as the photos make it look alot better than what it really is.  On top of that, as soon as we got out the car we were hassled by a bunch of street venders trying to sell us souvenirs.  Once your inside, they want more money to get a lift on the golf buggy to the temple.  A complete money grab.",2024-03-23,Couples,2024-03,,,
"Manhattan Beach, CA",5.0,"Borobudur, located in Magelang, Central Java, constructed between 778 and 850 CE and restored between 1907-11, is one of the Seven Wonders of the World (contemporary list) and UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the largest Buddhist temple compound in the world and features 2,672 relief carvings on the lower levels depicting images about the life of Buddha.

If you are driving in from Bali, be prepared for at least a 3 hour drive because of the traffic.  There are 9 stacked platforms topped by a central dome.

The tour guide was full of fascinating information about the history of the structure and its religious significance — I’m no Buddhist, but it was still very cool to learn about. The place is covered in intricate carvings from top to bottom, and all of the carvings are the originals, dating back to 7-800 A.D. - a number stones have been replaced, but UNESCO apparently mandated that no replacement carvings be added, to keep it as authentic as possible.Some advice — if you’re from a cooler climate like me, bring an umbrella or a hat or something.

You can either buy a ticket for just the grounds or the climb up the temple as well. If you purchase the climb up (which I recommend), you must book into a tour which also includes a bottle of water and a pair of sandals you must wear. It is not mandatory to cover your knees or shoulders to enter the temple. Once we got to Borobudur, the tour was well organized and very efficient. We had a tour guide for a group of 10. The tour guide did a great job explaining the temple to us, the history, the restorations completed, and the significance/meaning of many things.

I didn't check the price for this ticket. You can pay cash or card for this ticket (cash on the spot if you not doing any booking). I think there is no limitation on the numbers of visitors for this ticket. b) temple structure ticket, you can get into the temple. Foreigner price is IDR 455K, and for domestic is 120K. You can see the price in their website. You can only pay with card for this type of ticket.

The temple have time slots to limit the number of visitors per day.We booked a day tour with a guide to bring us around. You can get there on your own transport or join a tour.2. Bring an umbrella or hat as it can get very hot in the day.3. At the temple, you will be given sandals to change to which are included in the ticket. It is not an option therefore it does not matter what shoes you wear to the temple.4. The tour guide from the temple is included with the ticket.5. Last, to exit the temple is a never ending maze of souvenir shops. There is a long walk back to the carpark area.Enjoy your tour!!",2023-09-30,Couples,2023-09,,,

You have to pay ca 45K for the entrance, and that's only if you wanna walk around the temple or around.. if you want to go up and se every level of the temple, then you have to pay 20K more.Well, we had the money and although the hefty price, we payed.Then the circus started. Probably a relic of the pandemic, but the ""clever"" staff uses this smart. So many of the staff are just running around like headless chokes.

They have them called sessions where only 150 persons allowed in every hour. In reality the number is higher. Although the poster infront says 150 persons. Then they don't give you sarung to wear anymore but tell you to put local produced flip-flops so the temple would not sink as it has over the years. How do local produced flip-flops help with that?! Then you have to follow a guide and you have only one hour and then you have to exit the temple.What!!!! Our guide would not shut up the first 15 minutes, then told us that we gonna skip level one and go to level two directly.At that moment we left the group and did the rest by our selfs. We actually saw other groups sitting bored and listening to their guides that they didn't even want.But, great way to create local jobs and collect money.Met several foreigners in Jogja that told us they are skiping Borubudur because of the price.

He got turned back at the gate because we did not bring our IDs and asked to purchase an international tourist ticket which is 7.5 x higher than an Indonesian local tourist (IDR 375000 vs IDR 50000 just to see the ground level). Is this price really set by the Indonesian government or local company?  If so, how did this happen? Is this the way to attract international tourism and intentionally create so much disparity? That day, we decided to turn around from this scam tourism activity. We rather go somewhere else, not only because of the over-price issue but also the way we have been treated as an Indonesian heritage.

However unique it is to see such a large Buddhist temple in a country where it is hardly practiced, it is not as we envisioned it. It is pretty, and the tour guide was fun and very informative.Nevertheless, Borobudur deserved first price on discrimination (and I’m even partly Indo) and we were ripped off badly. We payed 1.7 million rp to see Borobudur and Prambanan, whilst a combi ticket for 2 pax should be 1.35 million rp in total. I asked why, and they could really not care less. I can understand behasa and heard them talking very tasteless about this thing I am or those things we tourists are. Little did they know I could understand them. Gosh, never in Indonesia have I ever experienced this! Also you pay for an hour visit, you can’t visit back the front of Borobudur from start beginning tour as you walk w the tour guide through the temple and are not allowed to return. You pay extra to climb the temple. You are not allowed to go to the real top as this is only for extremist or “double VIPs” (quoting the tourguide here, this I think means just pay more).

I found the most useful information in form of comments from local guides on Google maps. So here it comes: There are two type of visits. Going up to the temple or going around it. The second one is of course the easier. If you want to go up ( what I strongly recommend) there is a limitation. Maximum 150 people / timeslot. You can spend one hour up there ( checked on the way out). So the speed is 150/hour.You need to buy a ticket and you have to fit in a timeslot, otherwise you have to wait for the next timeslot or the next one.When you are through you get a bag to put your shoes in and a pair of slippers to wear during your visit ( many choose to go barefoot instead). You carry your shoes with you. A local guide control your movements during the visit. There are 15 people/ group. You get some free time at the top to take pictures ( ca 15-20 minutes). You climb down on the other side and are free to roam as long as you like around the temple.This new regulation was introduced after covid and is aiming to limit / organise the huge number of tourists visiting the site.It is pretty well organised when you finally understand how things work.On monday it is closed!

We booked a private car+driver (500k IDR) through our hotel, and bought combined tickets for Borobudur and Prambanan on site at the Borobudur entrance.I thought it would be helpful to clarify some of the other reviews and comments below. The temple recently reopened after a three year closure. Government regulations now state a maximum of 1200 visitors to access the actual structure itself each day. Tickets to go up the temple are 455000 vs the regular 365000 (Foreigner) price that only get you access to the grounds. Visitors are bundled in groups. Groups are assigned a guide, and leave on hourly timeslots. We arrived at 9am, were able to purchase our tickets at 930 (there is a ticket queue system), and immediatly were able to join the 930-1030 timeslot. You can buy tickets online on borobudurpark.com if you want to avoid any wait on site. Special sandals (and a tote bag to carry for personal shoes) are provided for those going up the temple. Our guide spoke perfect English and provided interesting background on the temple history and carvings. After an hour tour we had 15 minutes of 'free' time, due to the heat everyone was happy to descend before our slot finished. As the groups are staggered there is plenty of space to explore and it actually stops the temple from overcrowding. Im unsure what any additional time would have gotten us. All in all we were pleasantly surprised we were allowed up an ancient temple at all. The new system seems much more sustainable for the temple’s health and local economy.

You are forced up the steep stairs as fast as possible to the top then told to immediately exit. One hour time limit. We were threatened that if we didn’t go with the guide we would be refused access to the upper area by security. We managed to escape the guide but were then followed around by a security guard like a couple of would be thieves which was intimidating. The entire site is significant. The carvings on every tier are significant. One must walk around the WHOLE of the temple and look at all of the carvings to truly understand what the guides are even talking about. Or not, but that should have been our choice. And why shouldn’t we be allowed to take our time and  absorb the history at our own pace? We paid for that. We did not need or want a guide. We did not want to walk around in a large noisy group. We had already thoroughly read about the history of the site and had visited before. This visit was an outrage. Also take note on Monday’s you can’t climb at all.

NOT FAIR.One rule please; it should be the same for everyone.Further, if access is going to be limited, then the entry price should be significantly reduced to compensate.I fully agree with the other reviewers who feel they were ripped off because I certainly feel ripped off too.The signposting within the site could do with some attention. Many exits, but a LONG walk to the one where we entered the compound. I suggest retracing your steps rather than exiting at the rear of the temple and then attempting to find your way back from whence you came in the stifling heat.I should note that our Rp375K entry fee did include a 330ml chilled bottle of water per entry ticket. Whoopee!Not much compensation for all the $$ spent to get here and NOT be able to see the temple stupas I had long waited to see. STILL WAITING. Unimpressed.I have deleted my original review to add some additional information since received/discovered:The next day at our hotel we were told there was an 800-person daily limit set for those who were allowed entry to “climb” the temple. I can find NOTHING on the temple website alluding to this.However, I did find (fairly well hidden in the Operational Hours section of the website) that there IS limited access to the temple (too little, too late!). For those inclined to visit the Prambanan Temple as well/instead the same notation appears in their section of the website. We decided to give Prambanan a miss as one disappointment is more than enough.As I am (seemingly) not allowed to include a link, please Google-search: ""borobudur park operational hours of the temple parks"" and click the link to borobudurpark.com",2023-03-22,,2023-03,australia,-24.7761086,134.755

Thankfully, the tickets to enter the grounds of the Temple can be purchased at the ticketing booth with your credit card.I brought my student ID, from the U.S., and got a discount for this and the Prambanan Temple combo ticket. There is a booth after the ticketing counter where all the available official tour guides wait for clients. I hired an English-speaking one for 150,000Rp (cash only). The guide was very helpful but and was very knowledgeable so I still felt like it was worth it. The Temple used to be used for Buddhist ceremonies but since the beginning of COVID visitors have been prohibited from walking on its structure and can only walk around it. The guide told me that this will change starting January 2023 and they will once again allow visitors to walk on the Temple itself.The architecture and the carvings are truly a sight to behold.

"Sydney, Australia",1.0,"The entrance fee is insane. Paid $40 USD which included Borobudur and Prambanam temples.Note, they no longer let you climb the structure and you can't go for sunrise either.I thought this wouldn't be an issue as you can't climb the Pyramids or Chichen Iza in Mexico. But it is an issue, all you can see from the bottom is the first couple of levels. The level with the stupas can't really be seen from this point.Came a long way (from Australia) to visit this site in particular and was very disappointed. Also felt ripped off as there is obviously a different price for locals, which is much cheaper.If the goal is to preserve the site, I applaud that, but the entrance fee should be adjusted accordingly. Besikh Temple in Bali was much more impressive, could go all the way to the top and only costs around $4 USD to get into. I hear the Indonesian government is planning on a second ticket price option - for $110 USD you will be able to climb to the top. Which means it's not about preservation its just a scam to get money. Indonesian government need to learn that foreign visitors don't have unlimited resources.The other really crappy thing here is that you get herded through a huge market which is like a maze on the way out. I seriously didn't think I was ever going to get out of it and the vendors just hassle you to death because you're a westerner. The whole experience is just bloody awful.

,1.0,"Not one to leave bad reviews but feel like it is needed to warn others. A one star rating is being generous. I don’t think there is any reason to visit other than if you are nearby and want to tick the box of visiting Borobudur.Arriving at the ticket house you are warned that you cannot walk up the structure and that you can only walk around the base but entry will still cost full price. After paying your entry fee and entering the grounds you are immediately greeted by pushy guides trying to sell you a tour and people trying to sell cheap merchandise.After navigating through 10s of sales pitches, you finally make it to the temple and realise that even access around the base is limited due to ongoing maintenance and ground works. It feels a bit of a robbery as they are still charging a steep entry for limited access. Area surrounding the temple is very poorly kept for a historic landmark and most of the iconic structure of the temple is not even visible from the base which is very disappointing.After walking round for 10-15 minutes and you decide that you’d rather do something else, you are herded toward the exit which takes an extra 30 minutes of walking through a seemingly never-ending temporary marketplace labyrinth of more people aggressively selling cheap inauthentic merchandise. After following the 50th sign of the exit and finally exiting the labyrinth and thinking freedom has been reached, you are met with another permanent market of even more people trying to sell you more cheap merch. It was a relief to finally reach the exit and put an end to a terrible experience.Overall, I agree with other recent reviews that it feels more like a theme park with a short stop off at the temple. I accept that we were warned on entry that you cannot visit the top but it feels pointless going without that as the architecture means that the iconic part of the temple is not visible from the base.

Once you enter people jump out at you trying to aggressively sell you things, the guides were so pushy even though I told them I didn't want a tour. I spent a total of 5 minutes looking at the structure and 40 minutes leaving the site. You have to take this incredibly long walk to the exit, you will see so many signs with the false promise of freedom. Once you finally think you're at the exit you're forced to walk through a makeshift market structure that goes on forever and people continue to pressure you to buy junk souvenirs. Even after you finally make it out of the market there is a crowd of people with more tat. They also have elephants on site for people to pose for photos with, that kind of animal tourism is wrong.Don't waste your time or energy on this place.

Even if they allowed small groups to climb in order to maintain safety protocol and preserve the temple to UNESCO standards, it would be worth it. Just walking around the outside was a let-down and did not justify the steep admission price or the time and effort spent to travel there. We will be able to say that we saw Borobudur, but nothing more.

I still considered it worth visiting if you have the time, but if you are short of time in Indonesia you might skip it, especially if you think you may get back to the Yogyakarta sometime in the future, when hopefully you will be able to see the temple up close.  The problem is not just that you can't enjoy the activity of climbing the temple and enjoying the views from the top, it's that most of the impressive art work that Borobudur is known for is visible only when you climb onto the monument and go around the several levels.  As this isn't possible for now, the experience was very inferior to when I visited years ago, when I could spend several hours on the monument looking closely at the art work and carvings.  However, unlike some other reviewers, I'm not offended that they have not reduced the high admissions price for foreign visitors.  No doubt the renovations are expensive and I'm sure they need the money.  The staff made it clear that climbing wasn't possible before you even get to the ticket booth.

It’s disgraceful that they don’t. When selling you tickets in person they do, now, at least, warn you before you pay that you can’t go on the temple.But the temple is astonishing in its scale and beauty and, despite the irresponsibility of the people marketing it, and the current restrictions, it’s well worth travelling a long way to see, even just from its base.Couple of museums to look at on the way out, one about the archeology, which is poor, the other about the Buddhism, which is great. Both under-lit, weirdly: bring a light. Shockingly, they keep captive elephants chained up in a too-small enclosure in the grounds — animal cruelty that I hope will soon end.

This takes a serious knock out of the visit.The gardens are basically a ruse to get you to buy stuff, ranging from food to photos with elephants - on which, THERE ARE CHAINED UP ELEPHANTS. This is animal abuse, and it's not at all acceptable. At the entry, but particular at the exit, you're forced to walk through long streets of local market traders who try forcefully to get you to buy mass produced tat. The temple has clearly cooperated with the traders to push you through their stalls, and it's deeply uncomfortable.The temple itself is beautiful, and I'm glad we went, but it's not at all what it should be, and it's massively overpriced.",2022-08-12,Couples,2022-08,,,

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",5.0,"Hi , just returned from a 4 days trip to Jogya and wanted to share some tips and info which may help you if you are planning a trip to Jogya or Borobudur From airportThere is a train from the airport that goes directly into the Jogya city which would be convenient and cheap if you plan your arrival and travelling time well as the train runs on a fixed schedule. It would take approx 40mins to the city. However, tixs are limited and if you have adequate time gap, do buy your tickets online. The city and the airport is quite a distance (approx 45km) and takes approximately 1.5hrs. However, if you arrived late at night or early morning, traffic is low and the taxi driver can do the distance in an hour. Where to stay? Magelan or JogyaIf you are planning a day or two of outdoor activities (rafting, caving, hiking) then do stay on the outskirt or in Magelan area nearer to Borobudur. I am more of a city slicker and choose to stay in Jogya and used a day to visit the temples and then use the other days to explore the streets of Jogya and do batik shopping. How to move about?The attractions are pretty far apart and as such, you would need transport. Best if you can hire a driver who can double up as a tour guide. We got a driver at a very reasonable rate and he was with us for almost 12 hours fetching us around. PM me if you need his contact. In the city, you can always order a GRAB car or to use a motorised trishaw. Where to stay?In the city, I would recommend Phoenix or the new hotel 101 which is near Malioboro street. Temples to visitYes. Go and visit Borobudur and Prambanan temple. It’s awesome. Tip is to buy a twin ticket for one price that allows you to enter both temple.

The temple itself, consists of nine stacked platforms, (six square and three circular), topped by a central dome. It is decorated with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues. The central dome is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues, each seated inside a perforated stupa (mound), and we did our absolute darnedest to view them all.During our visit, we became aware that a large group of school children on an excursion, were undertaking communication assignments for their English language class. We became popular people to have conversations with, and were happy to help them with this. As a 'thank you', they treated us to a performance of a traditional Indonesian song, which was absolutely beautiful. I must note, that as we were leaving, it became evident that there were elephants and other animals in captivity at the site.

I hired a taxi guide to go here, I think others may rent cars or use public transportation. We arrived around 11 AM, the temperature was already very warm. We bought some hats and rent an umbrella, we came unprepared, hehe. From the gate to the temple the distance is around 200-500 meters, so we took a Delman ride (horse carriage) to circle around the vicinity before going to the temple, it was pretty fun! At the temple, the heat from the sun is unbearable, I then understood why most people recommend going here early in the morning or at dawn. My mom didn't go to the peak, only me and my friend did. There were quite a lot of people taking pictures at the inscription in the temple's walls,  I saw some people praying there too. I think it would've been better if I hired a guide to tell some stories about the temple, I didn't do this because I wasn't gonna be there for long given the very hot temperature and I still had to go to some places after Borobudur.We took the tour cart when exiting and then walked for a couple of meters towards the pick-up area.

Though my visit was planned for the afternoon my guide switched to the morning as it was cooler. Besides, rain was forecasted in the afternoon. So best time to visit is in the morning. We set out in our vehicle for the Unesco Heritage Temple Complex as early as 8 a.m. The weather was cool. Once we arrived at the Complex we had to go through ticket admission. Subsequently, we set out on foot to the Borobudur Temple Complex positioned in a beautiful green environment. It was a 15-20 minutes walk from the ticket entrance. The walk was so lovely and soothing. I took my hiking stick with me and it came handy. When we reached the temple my guide decided to use the walkway on the left instead of the temple steps in the centre. I think it was a good idea. The temple is magnificent from the outside and has beautiful 8th-9th century stone carvings.  After a few photos we started walking up the temple steps, which are high and steep. However, there are hand rails at the side of the steps so these helped together with my hiking stick. There are 3 levels to climb. At the first level we stopped and walked around to admire the amazing stone carvings, which are intricate in nature. An earthquake years ago did do some damage to the temple complex but it had since been restored. We then continued up to the second level where there are statues of Buddha and  huge stupas all round. It was an amazing sight. In each stupa there is a statue of Buddha too. Some of the statues are broken due to damage from the earthquake. The third and highest level has more huge stupas  and a main stupa at the centre but we were not allowed in as it was closed to the public. This can be viewed from the second level very clearly.

"Dunedin, FL",5.0,"Borobudur is the oldest and biggest temple we have.  This magnificent, impressive and somewhat overwhelming structure was built in the 9th CE. How Someone even conceived of such a splendid construction and someone else engineered it and someone else built it,  are all a mystery. And then you realize that the Western World was still in the Dark Ages as this stunning structure was built. That really brings the accomplishment of this structure home. I didn’t count, but I read that there are 75 Buddha’s there. Felt like more to me. Each stupa has one in it. Unfortunately some Buddha heads were looted.

I had to wear a sarong as I had shorts, but I seemed to be the only one as many locals wore shorts and no sarong. Coz I am white?? Lastly was the walk back to the car park, completely unnecessary one way system where one has to walk for miles around the outside of the temple area, through hundreds of vendors.

"Liverpool, UK",2.0,Only two stars. Should have been one. The temple is worth seeing but like in many tourist places in Indonesia it is a total rip off! Segregation on entry between locals and tourists. It's ok to charge tourists slightly more but to charge 6 times more than local is just insulting. Overpriced ticket gives you nothing extra. Place is swarming with people so after paying exorbital price you can't even get a decent photo. ( I expect high tourist activity wherever I go in places like that but this was just a joke!) Everyone around you is trying to sell you some junk in a very pushy manner. Food and drink is overpiced too. I have been taken there by my Indonesian friends and the whole expierience made them feel embarassed when they seen how much I have been charged. Indonesia need to learn more about tourism and learn how to care for people who leaves here quite big money when they visit. In different countries for that amount of money you get a full day tour full of activities and a guide.Overall what meant to be nice friends and family expierience turned out to be a grim insulting day that left everyone frustrated and embarassed.,2020-01-25,,,united kingdom,54.7023545,-3.2765753

"Woy Woy, Australia",4.0,"There is no doubt that Borobadur is a magnificent temple and it is well worth a visit. The site has been beautifully restored and the upper levels, in particular, are inspirational with their many Buddha statues and stupas.  The light is best for photographs at sunrise and sunset, but these are also very busy times. During the day, the crowds are smaller but it is also hotter. Do take plenty of water with you. If you are a foreigner, be prepared to be interviewed in English by the many schoolchildren who want to practice the language on you. There will be lots of them and they all have prepared scripts to work from. It's a lot of fun conversing with these shy kids. Overall, a visit to Borobadur is not to be missed, but it is slightly disappointing when compared to the magnificence of the Cambodian temples at Siem Reap. Moreover, as others have noted, a visit to Borobadur is expensive and the entire experience is ruined by being forced to navigate through literally hundreds of souvenir stalls in the stinking heat just get out of the site.

,4.0,"Very beautifully preserved historic temple. The details of the carvings, the symmetry of the lines and engineering are amazing considering it was made over a thousand years ago. To avoid the crowds, go early (6am early); If you want to spend a little more, do the Sunrise Tour (about $36 - includes breakfast buffet and a batik souvenir); this gives you time to go around the temple in peace (as most of the other sunrise tourists would’ve already left by the time the sun is up). However, make sure to leave the complex by the time the other tourists starts arriving (at about 8am onwards - it’s your funeral for you decide to stay or arrive after this time just to save a few bucks after traveling so far - I don’t understand why people do this and leave negative reviews here, upset because of the crowds. This is a tourist attraction, and the world does not revolve around you). There are also animal attractions along the exit route. If you are an animal lover (which I am), move along quickly for you might not like what you will see. Elephant rides, and animals in cages. No point in trying to compare how Indonesia runs their animal attractions to the way we run it in the west. Their country, their way of life. We are guests. We don’t like the way they do things, we can give our two cents, leave and never return.

I took a walking stick with me. It is also much hotter on the temple as the black volcanic stone gets hotter than the land around.

Climbing the stairs at the prevailing temperature there are not easy.  because it is a place where I do not go back it is proposed to focus on it and stay there longer. Be sure to bring water with you. The temple area is huge and it is worth taking a stroll around it but it is a tiring tour.  We were looking for a little shade to rest.

"Bengaluru, India",5.0,"We left our hotel at Yogyakarta and left for Borobudur by an innova car . The journey took us one hour 30 minutes a distance of about 40 Kms . We bought the tickets from the cab's office for both borobudur and Prambanan temple at IDR 607500 ( INR 3200 USD 44) . It was hot afternoon as soon as you alight the local vendors really make things difficult for you to move . I hired a wheelchair for my wife  IDR 150000 ( INR 800 USD 11) . we went through the entrance for foreigners and we were give 100 ml of water bottle each .  It was  quiet a distance to walk and the paths are well paved for wheel chair access and there is a ramp available to take the wheel chair to a certain level . There were 2 people pushing the wheel chair at the ramp . The temple consists of nine stacked platforms, six square and three circular, topped by a central dome. It is decorated with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues. The central dome is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues, each seated inside a perforated stupa.The pilgrim journey begins at the base of the monument and follows a path around the monument, ascending to the top through three levels symbolic of Buddhist cosmology: Kāmadhātu (the world of desire), Rūpadhātu (the world of forms) and Arūpadhātu (the world of formlessness). The monument guides pilgrims through an extensive system of stairways and corridors with 1,460 narrative relief panels on the walls and the balustrades. Borobudur has one of the largest and most complete ensembles of Buddhist reliefs in the world( extracted from wikipedia) The temple demonstrates the influences of Gupta art that reflects India's influence on the region, yet there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian.With little difficulty you can climb up to the last stupa . You get good feeling on reaching the top and you have 360 degrees view of the place . security is on the top level and guide you through. There are ways to go up and come down . I climbed down and in some places i sat down and  went down slowly as it was bit steep. It is really worth visiting this place",2019-11-25,,2019-11,india,22.3511148,78.6677428

Enjoy each platform and the morning sun give a hue over looking the stupa and buddha statue. Photo moments and as a respect to the holy place- no shorts for both male & female (cover the knee), no food intake in the temple -water is fine and wear good shoes. The step leading up is very steep and high. Not recommend for those who have knee issue or senior citizen. Remembered each stupa there is a Buddlha statue inside -so no climbing at all times. SUGGEST to plan half a day here, NEVER rush to another place as is huge.Down side for us is lack of direction signage to lead to exit point - as there is only 1 exit  plus there are 2 entrance.

The breakfast after the sunrise tour was also awesome - really delicious buffet with vegetarian options. We thought the expensive price (~$90 CAD for 2 adults) was worth it for the temple and food. However, on the way from walking to the temple to breakfast we saw elephants held captive in a small sad area with elephant viewing advertised as an activity (I can’t remember if riding was also an option). We didn’t understand this part of the grounds at all, why is it necessary to have these animals chained up here? Isn’t the point of the temple to see the temple, not exploit these animals? The temple experience would be drastically improved if the animal cruelty aspect was eliminated. Disappointing. I can’t imagine what tourists would be supporting this. It’s not like the cruelty was hidden, these elephants were being held captive in a tiny area in plain site.

We decided to stay in small local managed hotel, more like a home actually, with only 11 rooms. We took 1 Family room and 1 Standard room. Pool was nice; landscaping was beautiful, very clean and good breakfast. Hotels is called Rumah Mertua, away from the busy bustling city noise. We liked that. To move around, taxis are aplenty, but we decided to rent an MPV since there were 6 of us. Rental fee was not too bad Rp450k for 10 hours with driver and petrol.There are 2 shopping malls, the best is Ambarok Mall, newest. The older one is Malioboro Mall, should visit both.

"Winchester, UK",5.0,"Borobudur is the largest Buddhist temple in the world and was built in the 8th & 9th century, and rediscovered by Sir Stafford Raffles in 1814. It has been awarded UNESCO World Heritage status and it is well deserved. We visited Borobudur 15 years ago and went on an organised tour at sunrise. This time we went by ourselves for the sunset tour.I must say we enjoyed it even more the second time round.Firstly, we visited on a weekday in September, kids are back at school so not many people there and far less crowded. We arrived at 3pm having purchased our sunset tickets at the Manohara Hotel which is the only place you can purchase sunrise or sunset access (unless you have a pre-arranged tour). Be warned ticket prices for foreigners are much higher than for Indonesians by a few hundred percent.Apart from being less crowded there is more of an atmosphere of tranquility. The sunset at around 5.30p.m was a wonder to behold, a bright, deep red dipping sun. We left the monument at around 6pm and made our way back to the hotel where a free buffet is included as part of your admission ticket.One further advantage of the Sunset tour is you do not have to get up at 3am in the morning be at the Temple for 5am to be ready for the sunrise half asleep and waste the rest of the day feeling tired and exhausted.The only negative we can think of is that people who have not booked the Sunset ticket, which is more expensive than a normal entry ticket for locals, have to leave the Temple by 5pm, the security struggle to get them to leave and therefore at around 5.15pm there is a big rush of people leaving which can block your view for a while but not really a big deal",2019-10-01,,2019-10,united kingdom,54.7023545,-3.2765753

Foreigners pay a higher price..and you can also buy the Prambanan tickets here as well.

In addition to the temple proper, there is a good museum detailing the history of the complex--both its construction and subsequent renovation.  There is also a museum with a ship, but that's extra.  Just be warned that it can be extremely crowded. And one real drawback that should be addressed are the merchants.  For one, as you near the museum you'll be accosted by hawkers trying to sell you postcards and such.  Ditch them, and you find the exit to the parking lot takes you through a warren of small stalls.

Entry was formal and there didn't appear to be authorised guides so we hired one who was offering his services.  Like most Indonesians, he had taught himself English so his delivery and knowledge was limited.  However, we were glad to have him.  The area around the temple is vast and we were not given a map and nor is the signposting good.  The temple itself is large and more wondrous for its discovery than its character.  I had been told it was better than Angkor Watt but I beg to differ.  there were a lot of people and it was impossible to gain any sense of the site's spiritual nature.

It was simply mesmerising! Some valuable information follows:The nearest airport to the site is Yogyakarta (or Jogjakarta). If you are visiting Bali, you can fly domestic from the Bali airport and it's a 1:20Hr journey.There are many guest houses located near the Borobudur site. I have planned the trip in a way I had 1 full day to explore the site.As per the tickets, There are two types: The ""Regular"" tour is around 25 Aus$ and it allows you to study the site for the entire day. However, you won't be able to experience either the Sunrise or the Sunset with this ticket (These two session is of high demand. Therefore, they have introduced a special kind of ticket to remain on the site during these two windows).The other ticket type is Sunrise/Sunset, which is around 47 Aus$ and I would recommend buying this one as the sunrise/set is something I have especially enjoyed.I have picked the Sunset tour as during the sunset the Sun falls directly into the Buddha statue's face which gives a great photo-angle. On the other hand, I was too lazy to wake around 4 am for the Sunrise tour ;).You can climb the site.

We bought a joint ticket for both places at approx 630k each as international tourists. The site is expansive, like Prambanan, but we spent most of our time exploring the different levels of the main temple.  The view from each point is different and worth a picture at each point.  It is also lovely see to the restoration work taking place. It is overall amazing to see and beautiful in its stone.A good couple of hours, including a welcome drink, we’re enough to explore.  Similar to Prambanan, It is also good that the locals selling tourist items is at the end of the visit rather than in the way in like many Bali temples.",2019-08-08,Couples,2019-08,united kingdom,54.7023545,-3.2765753

It was however sad to see the guards chasing away tourists with normal tickets at about 5.15 when the sunset is beginning. So it has gotten much more commercial since my last visit. The entrance fees are also ridiculously high.

San Francisco,5.0,"Disclaimer: we did not encounter elephants or deer or any other animals. It would have ruined out trip too. Our home stay's owner Ika (Efata home stay is fabulous) advised against sunrise entrance knowing we do not like masses of humanity. Instead we went for sunset. It was a cloudy day. We went at 3 PM. The entrance and exit for Sunrise and Sunset tickets is different from normal entrance. We went straight to Monohora hotel's lobby, collected our Sunset stickers, and walked a few steps to the temple. The first sight was simply amazing. The masses were all busy climbing straight to the top and taking selfies. We took more than 2.5 hours to go around the carvings on all 4 levels. Even before climbing one step, go toward the East end to see 4 exposed panels on ground level. There are 160 of these. The other 156 had to be covered by stone to stabilize the entire structure. From these 4, you will get the idea of the artistic talent of these Javanese. At one point of admiring the carvings, Sun came out and the ""light show"" on the panels were simply out of this world. When Europe was in dark age, when Portuguese had no clue about navigation, these Asians were busy with their spice route, trading, spreading, and learning Buddhism, exchanging culture. During our 2.5 hours of going around we encountered one couple for 5 minutes with a guide and a family of 3 for another 5 monutes. The rest of the time we were alone. Finally we made it to the top to see the sun set. There were less than 30 people and with the exception of one Chinese family (who were loud, and disrespectful)  everybody else was quiet and very well behaved. Sunset was less than spectacular but the entire experience was beautiful and pleasant. There was a buffet dinner (included in the price of IDR 475,000 pp) at Monohora restaurant. We do not eat meat. The dinner had no meat. Although everything was cooked in poisonous palm oil, we ate something and went to our wonderful home stay feeling really rejuvenated. Once again, I am delighted we did not encounter the caged elephants, other animals, and hawkers but that is an ostrich mentality and I am sorry for that.",2019-07-20,Couples,2019-07,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882

Though the height of the structure and the steep stairs looked challenging we ventured the climb (there were hand railings which made the climb easier). There were different levels to the structure and at each of the levels we could take a walk around the perimeter of the structure to enjoy the beautiful stone sculptures on the walls which depicted the story of their times.

,3.0,"We went here as part of the 2 day package you can get with Prambanan. This means you get 1 ticket for both temples over a 2 day period. Arrived early but was still fairly busy. The temple is so good to visit. To begin with it was nice for locals to want to take your picture with you but it gets a bit irritating after a while. After you visit the temple you walk to the museum where you learn more about the temple but on the way there is an elephant enclosure where they have elephants chained by the ankle and guided around their pen with a poker! (Not happy to see this still happens) don’t know what reason they need to have elephants here either. Once you pass the museum you are ushered though a market where you get harassed to buy stuff. Finally when you reach the end you are dumped somewhere in the car park with no direction of where to go to find your vehicle. Great temple let down by other factors. Top tip: don’t go on a Sunday.

After we fought our way to the entrance and got one ticket for Indonesians ($ 5) and for foreigners ($25) we opted to get a guide which was a blessing in disguise. At least he provided an informative tour and helped us to stay away from the masses which crawled all over the temple. People were simply reckless and disrespectful of the temple. And there were so many pushing and shoving...One trick in crowd management is to take the exit to walk in as you will bypass the masses. Please make sure not to take the official exit as it will force you to walk by many other ""attractions"" including a never-ending maze of shops.

The air was naturally crisp and the ruins were - of course - a site to behold - and a testament to its timeless glory. It takes good leg power to move around and climb the steps to the stupas and for those able, the  morning lights and sights are a joy to behold. There are many travel/tour partners that can be teamed up with and most recommend early-morning trips to the site.

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"Our hotel was quite far from Borobudur so we had a 3.15am pickup to get there in comfortable time. The drive was uneventful, and because we used ""Discover Your Indonesia"", they arranged the tickets for us so we were just handed the tickets, our torch and sticker when we got there and we free to enter.  Otherwise I am told we have to bring our passports to fill in some details? Our driver / guide couldn't go in with us, he told us we could have gotten a local guide for about 240,000Rp (I think) but it was my husband's second time there so we did without the guide.  Making our way to the temple complex was easy - not many signs but the path was quite obvious.  In retrospect, I do think getting a guide would have been worthwhile to understand the stories behind the complex as well as the very many reliefs on the walls.  Our visit was more like a very picturesque place to take sunrise photos.  Our sunrise was quite cloudy, but still beautiful, and we were later rewarded with the sun coming up over the low hanging mists which was also beautiful, if not an actual sunrise.The morning tickets (475,000Rp per person) came with a torch in the morning (although it was dark we didn't really use them), as well as a buffet breakfast at the Manohara post visit (nothing to write home about but it was nice to have some coffee and nasi) and a little souvenir bag with a batik scarf inside .I had arranged for the car all day (12 hours) but we decided to go straight back to the resort to be in time for breakfast there, and because we had a trek scheduled in the afternoon.I'd say definitely worth visiting and compared to my husband's previous day-time visit, there was a sense of peace there and much fewer people (and of course if was magnificent). The weather was also lovely - probably in the low 20s and dry so I was comfortable in a t-shirt and light jacket. It gets hot in the day.

It doesn't take long to walk to the top although the steps up the temple are pretty steep, probably not the best for people we leg problems.The crowd sits along the edge and waits for the sunrise to make it's way over the mountain. Only a few complaints: 1. Although torches are provided to make your way through the dark, people keep their torches on while sitting and can be a little annoying and take away from experience. 2. People aren't very respectful when it comes to photography. It feels a little like an obstacle course. Many people walking either in your frame or you accidentally walking in someone else's.Tip.Watch the sunrise from the second top level. It's just as pretty and not many people watch it from here.

"Salt Lake City, UT",5.0,"This is one of the main reasons why we came to Yogyakarta. This temple is amazing. We hired a guide from WithLocals  because we wanted to be motivated to get up early. It would have been just as easy to hire a driver. One of the best parts about having a guide is we left through the handicapped/stroller entrance and avoided all the vendors other complained about. Maybe dealt with 3 vendors.  I was perfectly fine paying the large fee for the temples. We paid $45 per person for both Borobudur and Prambanan. These temples are immaculate and well maintained. Did you see what had to happen to restore this site? They also have to remove ash every time there is a volcano eruption. Someone needs to pay for that and it should be the foreign tourists. Tourists make more of a mess and wear and tear on sites. If you want to stick to a backpackers budget do go here. Less crowd for me!!Others mentioned something about elephants being treated poorly. I never saw an elephant but that also might be because I left through an alternative entrance.

It was a cloudy day, so I didn’t bother with the sunrise tour,but went as soon as it opened to the general public and it wasn’t that crowded compared to later. It’s a bit of a walk, but the temple is magnificent and there is an interesting museum in the grounds , included in the fairly steep price. There is a separate ticket booth for foreigners on the left as you go in. It’s worth reading up about before you go, as the design represents the cosmology if Buddhism and the carvings on each level are significant too. Well worth a visit, but I would stay in Borobudur as I did and not try and do it on a day trip from Yogjakarta, as the traffic is horrendous as you would have to leave very early.

We desired to head down to get some breakfast. On our way down we walked by a place called “The Elephant House” and witnessed the people working there was riding and beating one elephant that was chained to the ground. If this was training or whatever is not good to say, but it definitely wasn’t nice to witness. We stood and watched them trying to get the elephant on his feet and when he couldn’t do it they beat him with a stick over his head (which is the most sensitive part on an elephant). They forced him on his feet and you could clearly see the elephants distress of this “training”. It was disgusting and horrific to watch and I wish I new this before I paid the entrance fee to this temple. Sad that something like this ruined a very magnificent temple. There were four elephants that we could see. Only one of them were chained to the ground the others were locked in small cubes with no space to move.

Combined ticket Prambanan - Borobudur is 630k for international tourists whereas it is 75k for locals. This is scandalous, and they refused my student card because they couldn't read French. Wtf ?I am guessing part of this price goes to fund the horrible elephant place. The animals are chained, living in that small place every day and every hour of their life, just being here for tourists to take pictures & ride with. I hated seeing this and I will write Borobudur about this.The temple visit should be limited per day, like a real quota. Or put more security people. Because what they describe as a ""magical, mystical experience"" is once again ruined by just too many people, disrespecting the monument by climbing on it. Like a church, I think this place should be silent.

"London, UK",3.0,"We spent two days in Borobudur to make the most of this village and what it has to offer. The Borobudur complex itself is something worth seeing, but, first of all, it is way too expensive for what it is. As beautiful and interesting it is, 35NZD is a bit too pricey, especially compared to other UNESCO sites we’ve seen. The Angkor Wat in comparison costed 80NZD but for a 3days pass. The site is overcrowded (which one isn’t!?) with disrespectful tourists who clearly don’t care about the fact that it is a sacred site and it’s rude to climb, sit, touch the statues (and it’s clearly stated in many many signs all over the place). We spent the 2hour visiting the temple constantly having to turn away people who ask you for selfie or having to look at them being disrespectful about such a place. It def doesn’t make your visit any better. It’s overall worth seeing but to be honest like other things in Indonesia, we have found them overrated and over priced (especially when you’ve travelled to other countries and seen a lot more).",2019-04-03,Couples,2019-04,united kingdom,54.7023545,-3.2765753

"Seattle, WA",5.0,"I often find that the most famous sights in a country are so hyped, so crowded, and so commercialized that they are underwelming. Borobudur is certainly hyped, crowded, and commercialized. And yet it’s a beautiful and unique ruin, painstakingly restored, and absolutely worth seeing.A few tips for your visit.First, a lot of visitors pay extra for the Manohara Resort’s exclusive 4:30A access for sunrise hoping to recreate one of those iconic shots of Borobudur. You can do that. But, at least in March, I found that arriving at 6:00A was just fine. It was cheaper, the crowds had thinned out, and there was still an hour of beautiful lighting and atmospheric mist offering plenty of good photo opportunities. All of the attached photos of the summit were taken between 6:30A and 7:30A. So unless you are dead set on catching those few moments where the sun crosses the horizon, consider enjoying the extra hour of sleep!(That said, you’ll definitely want to go in the early morning or late afternoon; it is miserably hot, crowded, and far less photogenic midday.)Second, the vast majority of visitors immediately climb to the top, spend an hour, then go onto their next destination. That’s a mistake. While the top level offers some of the best Instagram opportunities—and should certainly be where you go around sunrise or sunset—the lower levels provide the most historical and artistic significance with hundreds of remarkable stone reliefs. As an added bonus, you’ll encounter comparatively few visitors here, and the walls offer welcome cover from the afternoon sun.Third, and related, many visitors come to town exclusively for the temple, and then move on. If you’re more adventurous and have the time, however, then the nearby villages are full of charming and welcoming people, astonishingly beautiful scenery, and a couple of smaller temples. Those are easily as memorable for me as Borobudur itself. I highly recommend booking at one of the nearby bed and breakfasts (I loved Etafa Home Stay), renting a bike (if one isn’t provided for you), and spending a couple of days exploring the surrounding countryside.(Note: If you’re planning on also visiting Prambanan, you’ll want to see Borobudur Temple on either your first or last day, as you save a lot of money if you buy a joint ticket—but you have to visit each within one day of each other.)I only stayed two days in Borobudur, opting to spend another two days in Prambanan. And while I enjoyed my time in Prambanan, I think I’d have preferred skipping it entirely and spending more time in and around Borobudur. The temple is a must-see when you’re in Indonesia, but the entire area is beautiful.",2019-04-02,Solo,2019-03,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882
"Dublin, Ireland",5.0,"Borobudur is the largest Buddhist monument in the entire world! Borobudur is an ancient Mayahana Buddhist monument and the largest such monument in the entire world. You can easily get to Borobudur from Yogyakarta by public bus.

If you want to really understand Borobudur, you’ll need to devote 2 or 3 days to the monument and for that it’s better to stay in the immediate area outside the park. There are several guesthouses (losmen) and basic hotels in Borobudur village, although the prices are (predictably) somewhat inflated here compared to normal Indonesian standards. Borobudur is at its most atmospheric during sunrise or sunset. However, busloads of tourists like to arrive at sunset for their selfie snaps so the best way to beat the crowds is to arrive before dawn. Unfortunately, the entrance fee to Borobudur for foreign tourists is  high, as is the case with many high-profile UNESCO world heritage sites.The main reason you’d hire a guide at Borobudur is to have him explain the bas-reliefs, which read like some kind of encrypted message without a guide’s expert knowledge. The monument is divided into 9 distinct platforms, of which the first 6 platforms are square and the upper 3 are circular in shape.If you plan to visit this monumental temple and want to understand the architectural marvel, do read our 'The Ultimate Guide To Visiting Borobudur' on our website (Link in the profile/bio)",2019-03-26,Couples,2018-04,ireland,52.865196,-7.9794599

,3.0,I visited Borobudur last month with my boyfriend. Despite the fact that it was heavy rain that day we really enjoyed our day in Borobudur but there was one thing we didn’t like at all. Next to the exit from the temple is a corral with two elephants. These elephants were chained with iron chains maybe 5 meters long. They simply couldn’t move. It was so sad to watch it. I think that is really cruel to handle with these beautiful animals like that. What’s the point of that? They are already in the corral and there is water ditch around them. They don’t need these chains.,2019-02-20,Couples,2019-01,,,

One signboard shows the history & process of Borobudur Temple Restoration since its first rediscovery by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1812 . It also shows visitors  how to enter the Temple from east entrance and for Buddhist devotees to continue to circle it clockwise for 3 times at each level for the worship ritual (the temple on your right side). In total it takes climbing 320 step through to the top! Along each of the levels, there are lots of stone carvings on many relief panels  depicting stories of the biggest Javanese Kingdom in the old days , surrounded by sculptures and small Buddha statues. The stone carved relief panels actually depicted the life of Buddha and his disciples. At the higher levels there are many stupas housing a small Buddha statue within.

The temple has nine levels and as I recall over 1,500 stupas, with the stupas typically sheltering a statue of buddha.  Unfortunately, a number of statues have been beheaded for collections.  There are also impressive bas-reliefs.  The structure is impressive by its mass from afar, and by the detail of its stonework up close.

These sorry looking creatures were chained up with chains that seemed barely more than a foot in length, meaning severely limited movement. There was a huge pile of dung behind one of the elephants. Elephants appeared to be spending their entire captive hours attempting to break their chains with their feet. Disgraceful abuse of these beautiful amimals. When I asked our tour guide why the elephants chains were so cruelly short, he responded that it was to stop them roaming into the village overnight, as there is ZERO supervision for them overnight. The enclosed area was pretty ample in size. He did not answer my question as to why chains needed to be so short. This would NEVER be allowed in Ireland. Dublin Zoo has amazing freedom for their animals. Indonesia seems to be about 50 years behind as regards animal rights. (See also cevi cats abused in tiny cages for Laewak coffee). DISGUSTING!!!

HOWEVER, the reason I gave 3 stars is because they offer elephant rides, which is appalling, even more because this is a Buddhist temple and Buddhism teaches about not harming any living beings. If you are planning to ride an elephant here or anywhere, don't. The things done to these poor creatures in order to break their spirit are inhumane.  Myself and my friend both felt blindsided, as we didn't see any mention online about the elephant rides.

,1.0,"Let me preface this by saying that I have traveled widely, from Asia to Europe to Africa to the Americas. Never have I seen a tourist trap more blatant and thorough. Not at the pyramids, not in New York, not anywhere. We pulled into the entrance, and before our engine had the chance to fall silent, people were scurrying up either side of our car trying to sell us things. Upon actually stepping out of our car, I realized what I had gotten myself into. Alas, it was too late - I had to commit. Beyond the swarm of people accosting you to buy the same 3 souvenirs lay my next grievance - the ticket office. Now it's all well and good should you happen to be Indonesian, as my partner is; go to the right, and pay ~$4AUD for your ticket. Not so bad, right? Wrong; because if you are a foreigner which, of course, you are likely to be if you're coming here, you'll fork out an extortionate $35AUD for your ticket. Thirty. Five. Without mentioning all that is wrong with the price differential itself, barring maybe NYC and Dubai, I can't recall when I last paid $35 to get into any attraction, let alone a mediocre one in a developing south east Asian nation. Barely managing to calm my heart rate from the robbery I had just fallen victim  to, we carried on to the temple itself. Now, Borobudur Temple itself is a pleasant enough piece of ancient architecture. The spiralling bells create a nice contrast to the lush green hills in the distance, ideal scenery for any photographer. If it was just that, I'd err on the side of saying it is worth a visit, even with the eye watering price tag in mind. However, reality faulters from the description. The afformentioned perfect photograph opportunities will be close to non existent, owing to the mass of tourists on every square inch of ground who will likely occupy every frame you shoot. There isn't a whole lot else to do in the complex, unless you're partial to being stared at and having not-so-sneaky photos of you taken by locals; we spent around 45 minutes at the temple before we were could no longer walk due to being knee deep in our own sweat. We headed for the exit.In case you feel that your wallet isn't yet light enough, upon exiting you are subjected to a sequel to your arrival.

However, this time it is not just inflicted on international travelers but on everyone. You are farmed into a market maze where you have to find your way out after being disoriented by the stall after stall that look the same. You feel like your are going around in circles. If you want my advice try to back track and go out the gate from where you entered, say you forget something in your car or something. This way you will avoid the maze at the end.Middle: Another annoying thing is that the place is totally over crowded, people everywhere, it's impossible to get a photo/vid that is sans random idiots climbing over various parts of the structure.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",5.0,"Borobudur is situated about 1 1/2 hrs from Jogjakarta city centre, and is about 1hr and 20 minutes from Mt Merapi (one of the most active volcanoes in the world). This was actually my second visit to the Borobudur, my previous visit was in the early 90's.  It is a lot more crowded now than when I first visited !!!  The temple itself is the largest Buddhist Temple in the world and dates back to the 9th Century (it was actually started in the 8th Century but took 75 years to complete).  It was given UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1991 after a massive restoration project.  It is one of the Seven man made wonders of the world.The Temple (or Candi) itself is 35m high and the square base platform is 118m long on each side.  Above the base platform are six square terraces each lined with magnificent bas relief sculptures depicting the story of Buddha.  The terraces are connected by steep staircases (each side of the temple has ascending staircases, so four in all).  Above the square terraces are three large and open circular terraces, there are a total of 72 stupas on the circular terraces (some containing Buddha statues, some with headless statues and some empty).  Above the circular terraces, and marking the top of the temple, is a large central stupa.The views of the surrounding countryside and mountains, including volcanoes are magnificent.  When the Mt Merapi volcano erupted in 2010 the ash covered the Borobudur Temple resulting in another major restoration project.An entry fee of US$25 is charged for non Indonesians pp (US$10 for Indonesians pp), the ticket office is also a money changer.  Dress modestly, sarongs are provided free of charge at the entrance should they be needed.  Bring water as it gets hot and the steps on the temple are steep !!  There are many places to get food and drink both inside temple complex and immediately outside the main entrance.  Buying souvenirs is not a problem, but haggle hard (and I mean really hard !!).

"London, UK",5.0,"Built from 2 million stone blocks and 1200 years old, Borobudur is an amazing Buddhist monument, but only if you experience it in the right way without the crowds. This is the most important thing I can’t emphasise enough. To do this you have to buy a special sunrise or sunset ticket which allows early or extended entry. I bought a sunset ticket and the difference without the hundreds of people is massive. Before sunset, the people with normal tickets have to leave and when I went, there were only 6 people left at sunset! It was like having Borobudur to myself! Only then can you get decent photos and appreciate the atmosphere of the place. To buy a sunrise or sunset ticket you need to go to a different gate - 8 - which is the old Manohara hotel which is undergoing refurbishment and conversion into a Buddhist monastery. It’s about a 20 minute walk from the main gate and although the sunset ticket costs more than a standard entry ticket you also get a free buffet dinner and souvenir gift. If I had only visited with a standard ticket with the hundreds of other people and large groups of noisy school kids, I would have felt cheated.

This will indicate that you are interested in their goods and will pester you all the way until you reach the exit. My advice is to purchase goods/souvenirs where the undercover structured type stalls are located which is before your main exit. Don't be surprised to see a line up of beggars sitting on the boarded off fence after you've left the stalls/exit. It's very upsetting but it is what is it - after all you are in Indonesia.

"Hong Kong, China",5.0,"Borobudur is unbelievable and you could easily lose several hours or days there. It is the largest Buddhist temple in the world, is decorated with nearly 2,700 relief panels and over 500 Buddha statues, is nine storeys high, and has a central dome surrounded by 72 Buddha statues, each seated inside a perforated stupa (a bell shaped dome).  Without a guide, you miss much of the history of Borobudur as well as the meaning of the carvings.  To get a full interpretation of the reliefs and the history would take years!  Borobudur is of the Mahayana tradition and therefore focuses on “the journey” — using one’s life to enlighten other people. The temple itself is nine stories high — nine is a mystical number in Mahayanan Buddhism: besides being nine stories high, there are nine volcanoes surrounding Borobudur, and there are nine temples in the area, configured around the temple in distance or design in such a way that the number nine is always prominent.  The first level of the temple symbolises life before the Buddha, the good people and the bad people and the punishments of bad behaviour and the rewards for good behaviour, but all are people who do not have the spiritual guidance to take them to the next level.  The second level depicts the birth of Buddha and his instruction and growth through life.  The third level introduces the idea of “formless meditations,” and there are four of these — infinite space, infinite consciousness, infinite nothingness, and neither perception nor non-perception.  Each level is harder to attain. At the summit, level nine, is unity with the Buddha.We were awed.",2018-09-29,Couples,2018-08,china,35.000074,104.999927

"Perth, Australia",4.0,"We felt very ambivalent about our visits to both Borobudur and Prambanam, not because the structures themselves lacked grandeur or significant interest, but because so much more could be done in terms of interpretation and the visitor experience, especially given the eye watering entrance fees being charged for foreigners.  The temple itself is magnificent and quite awe inspiring and its restoration is praiseworthy, but there is something lacking in the overall visitor experience.Borobudur does have more information than Prambanam, about the monument in the museum, but only marginally.  They build extensive museum buildings and then put virtually nothing in them.  There is a missed opportunity here.  Firstly, visitors should be funnelled initially through a museum, or interpretive centre,  to give them context and information for what they are about to see, it would undoubtedly greatly enhance their experience of the temple itself.  If they are not interested they could skip it, but I think many people would feel more satisfied, if there was a world class interpretative visitor centre or museum housed within the complex grounds.  As it is, one is left to do ones own extensive research in books and online.  The local guides, I eavesdropped in on, taking other foreign visitors around, seemed to be making stuff up as they went along. Some of what I heard was nonsense, timescales wildly incorrect , (I heard one gentleman telling his group Borobudur predates the Egyptian pyramids ??????) and a in another instance, a strangely Islamic interpretation on the story of Buddha and the spread of Budhism in this time period......?? Really.. That was news to me and I'm a historian.

,3.0,- Very touristic but a great view. We didn’t see it by sunrise and that probably gives it all the magic but the view was still epic at daytime. Quite a challenge not to have other visitors on your pictures. High stairs so be prepared for some squat exercises to get to the top. In the park surrounding the temple it’s quite quiet. The museum gives some explanation but not extensive. If you want to know more about the history: Google (free WiFi in the whole park). Elephant rides are free but the animals get poked by the staff with sharp object to keep them obedient so that is really sad and you shouldn’t support it by taking the ride (that only lasts like 3 minutes anyway). Lots and lots of market stalls with tourists T-shirts etcetera. A bottle of water also costs more inside the park than outside! DON’T FORGET YOUR STUDENT ID FOR DISCOUNT!

A photocopy of your passport is required to purchase the ticket at Rupiah 450,000 per person.  You get a small torchlight with ticket purchase.  There are helpful guides (free) and signages for how to get from ticket counter to temple, which was a relatively short walk.  The stairs up were rather steep and high but you can rest along the way.  Also as it was rather cold, the climb was quite comfortable.

Once you leave the temple there are also guides to point you in the right directions to get to your car.  It was so refreshing to not have touts and vendors harassing you.  A very nice overall experience.  Tip:  In the dark it was difficult to determine where East (Sunrise) was but there are actually signboards on the wall to indicate it, so use your torchlight to find it.

The driver told us that usually people visit the temples in the other way, but we kept with our plan and we were thrilled with the experience. We got to Prambanan around 8am and it was quite empty, a joy to walk around. By 9.30 am it got really hot. We were with 3 kids so rented a mini electric car to get to the other temples. It was a great idea because it would have been a long walk for my younger and not necessarily very worth the effort. We went back to the hotel to rest and chill out a bit and departed at 3.00 to Borobudur. It took us nearly 2 hours but it was nice to see the different villages until Borobudur. As we wanted to buy the sunset ticket we went directly to Manohara Restaurant where they sell sunrise and sunset tickets. It was nearly 30 minutes before closing time for the rest of people so it was already quite empty. From 5.30 to 6.30 (sunset time) we stayed in the temple with only few people! An unbelievable experience!!!! The sunset was amazing and to be there nearly on your own was just incredible! We stayed there until 6.25 when it was quite dark. The children enjoyed using the torches provided at the restaurant to go back to the car.Although our driver told us that Borobudur is most popular for sunrise and Prambanan for sunset, just doing the other way and avoid the crowd was so worth it!!!!! specially for us that we were with our 3 children.

Despite only having 2 hours sleep at our homestay after a gruelling 28 hour journey from England, it was completely worth it.

This meant we caught the end of the sunrise and the experience was one of the best things I’ve ever done. The view is spectacular, especially on a clear day, and we didn’t find that it was overly busy at that time. If we weren’t on such a tight budget, we would definitely have gone for the sunrise ticket so I recommend that to anyone who can afford it. In terms of amenities, there are toilets as you enter and breakfast is served for a small price at the on-site hotel (you don’t have to be staying here to eat at their outdoor restaurant). There are large gardens to walk around after you get down from the temple and elephant rides are available if that’s something you’re looking for.

Indonesia,5.0,"as one of the most visited single tourism spots in Indonesia, I assume nothing can be said something completely new about Borobudur Temple. it’s also one of the my most visited place around Central Java and Yogyakarta, as all my guests always wish to visit this place. imo, the different is that the intention of visiting this temple, as probably just seeing it directly by one’s eyes and having picture or going deeper to its history. it is really unsolved mystery temple, where even the name, purpose, and the exact founder are all still unsolved. another important aspect of Borobudur Temple is its social aspect towards the early villagers surrounding the temple who were being evicted but never been satisfied with the land compensation during the old regime of Indonesia. if you have time, you can also visit several other interests on the same compound, such as Karmawibhangga (archaeology), Samudra Raksa (Nautical) Museum, & Manohara (Center of Borobudur Study). Outside Borobudur Park, tourists can combine the visit to Mendut, Pawon, or Banon Temple. TIPS: - sunrise or sunset from upper temple is good moment- when too crowded, you better climb from left or back-side - if you decide to buy something, you better know how to bargain- another great time is during Waisak Day (the celebration of birth, enlightenment and death of Buddha Siddharta Gautama, on full moon in either April or May each year. - always good to check this temple website before visiting to have good timing for its different attractions.",2018-08-20,Friends,2018-05,indonesia,-2.4833826,117.8902853

Singapore,5.0,"The sky was clear, we were waiting for the sunrise. It had the makings of a beautiful day. We had been sitting patiently for more than a hour. But a huge bank of cloud drifted in at the last minute, and that was it! No sunrise moment for us, no peek of the golden disk above Mt Merapi!Still it was a gorgeous monument. We enjoyed the entire tour tremendously.Staying at Jogya, we had to wake up at 3 am, in order to depart at 3:30 am. That early morning car-ride was one of the most enjoyable I had. There was little traffic, the morning was cool. Anticipation made great company on that car-ride.When we arrived at Mahota Resort, it was crowded! And it was only a little after 5 am!We got our tickets and went up the monument. I estimate we reached the top (after 99 steps more or less), it was about 5:20 am. But most of the ""best"" seats at the top were already taken.Our guide led us to a spot on a stupa where we could see still Merapi. So we sat and waited. And you know about the cloud covered peak moment at 6:15 am.We explored the temple after that, with our guide leading us from the 9th level, where we were, down to the 1st level. It was fascinating understanding the restoration work and the stories and lessons carved on the walls of the temple. Although coming from the 9th level downwards, we were getting the wall stories backwards!When we were leaving the grounds, a school group was coming in, thru the cheaper non sunrise ticket, and they were singing.

Considering how crowded the area was while everyone was waiting for sunrise, this was unacceptable. We left our hotel at 430am and made it to the temple by 515am. Our driver pre registered for us so we just had to pick up the tickets. It costs 450,000 to go up for the sunrise tour. They give you a torchlight and a map with the tickets.  It includes a hot drink and a scarf after you return the torchlight. When we got up there it was already packed with people, with everyone facing the east. Sunrise was around 530am, and I strongly recommend that you stay until around 8am so you have less people in your photos. By 630, at least half of the crowd was gone and it was much easier to have pictures without many people.

The site was ""lost"" due to multiple earthquakes and volcanic eruptions; local people of course always knew it existed.  The exploration of the site started in the late 19th Century during the Dutch colonial period.  The current restoration incorporates new drainage features and other elements designed to make the monument more resistant.

The monument features beautiful sculptures and freizesYou can easily visit both Borobudur and its contemporaneous Hindu counterpart, Prambanan, in a single day if you hire a car and driver.

The guides provide good information and also steer you to good locations for photographs, help you move through the temples by herding other visitors into more organized lines moving up and down stairways.

"San Francisco, CA",5.0,"We visited the temple last month and it was wonderful. For a variety of reasons we chose the sunset tour and it turned out to be a great choice for a number of reasons. The main reason was that we were among just a handful of guests at that hour who were allowed onto the Temple. We were guided by a phenomenal tour guide named A Latif who definitely had a resemblance to President Obama. His English was excellent as was his knowledge of the temple .We slowly ascended the 10 levels beginning about 60 minutes before sunset. One could climb up in just a matter of a minute or 2 but we meandered so that we could enjoy the details along the way. At each level Mr. Latif explained relevant aspects of the building and we came to understand how the temple itself was a sort of book with stone panels telling the buddha's story. For example, Mr. Latif provided wonderful insights on how the hand positions of the various buddha's along the way communicated different aspects of the buddha's teachings. He also pointed out which stones (about 10%) were added more recently than the original ones from the 7th and 8th century. These are marked in a subtle way. He had lots of facts and figures on the number of buddhas at the temple including how many with and without the heads still intact. Once at the top we observed a very pretty sunset and could see the surrounding rural villages. There were only a handful of other guests most perched with cameras on tripods to capture the sunset as a beautiful backdrop for elements of the temple in the foreground. We could also hear the call to prayer as it rang out in slightly asynchronous times from each village. The sound provided a unique soundtrack to the otherwise peaceful quiet at the top of the temple. It is a very special place and very worthwhile attraction. It is a tribute to the Indonesian people that although the temple is not of a religion followed at the present time by most of its people, it is an important part of the country's past.

There were only a handful of other guests most perched with cameras on tripods to capture the sunset as a beautiful backdrop for elements of the temple in the foreground. We could also hear the call to prayer as it rang out in slightly asynchronous times from each village. The sound provided a unique soundtrack to the otherwise peaceful quiet at the top of the temple. It is a very special place and very worthwhile attraction. It is a tribute to the Indonesian people that although the temple is not of a religion followed at the present time by most of its people, it is an important part of the country's past. As the light dimmed we gently wound our way back down where we had a chance to stop at a nearby guest center to enjoy some tea, coffee and a snack.",2018-08-02,Couples,2018-07,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882

The fact that it was during Ramadan may have contributed to the relative quiet as well. I see numerous reports of sunrise tours being overrun. It may be worth the heat and missing that spectacle in order to be able actually to see the place. BTW the small museum nearby is also well worth a look, as there are fascinating accounts of the monument's restoration and various trials and tribulations, which are not over, as the hordes of tourists that visit it are causing significant deterioration.

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"There is an option for a sunrise or sunset tour, and we took the former. Entrance fees are more expensive for sunrise/sunset tour; foreigners pay Rp. 450K. The fee comes with a torch rental (visitors usually reach the entrance around 4.30am), post-tour light breakfast with coffee/tea and a scarf. Visitors are encouraged to wear decent clothing (pants, t-shirt i.e. no excessive flesh bearing) though it appeared there was no strict enforcement,It is a short 5 - 10 mins walk from the entrance to the temple, and given this is done in the dark and cool air (compared to the day's stifling heat), it was a refreshing stroll to wake up your senses. It is also quiet, and gives you some time alone among the expanse (more on that later). Once you reach the temple entrance, you can explore around and wait for the sunrise, or go straight up the stairs to the highest point. You can see where all the tourists are gathered, or use your phone's compass to determine where East is (for sunrise). There are also guides you can hire to introduce you to the history of the temple, though we did not opt for it.It seemed that everyone was able to pick (what they think is) a good spot to view the sunrise, and there was no scrambling for spots (which is good). Bring a sweater if you are afraid of the cold, though it didn't seem particularly cold or windy when we were there. As the sun rises, you begin to see the heavy mist still enveloping the lower reaches of the temple, lending a mysterious touch to them. The sunlight also reveals two mountains in the background, one of which is Mount Merapi. These, along with the sunrise, make for good and many photo opportunities (one of which is pictured). As we leave the temple, you can see that the path to the temple is a wide expanse of greenery, carefully manicured and well maintained. Being a UNESCO World Heritage Site, I must say (I hope) they have put the money from entrance fees to good use in the upkeep of the site.

We quickly grabbed a spot to sit and wait for the sunrise to appear.I took a walk around the highest level of the temple and it's such a unique experience to be around in such early hour compared to the usual tourists rush hour. The light and colors began to emerge from the clouds as time passed. Unfortunately the sky was too cloudy and we couldn't witness the sunrise. For the record we couldn't even see where the sun is. I asked a local tour guide who accompanied foreigner tourists about the sunrise and he said that the clouds blocked the sun so that it wasn't visible.

We spent several hours exploring the place and had unfortunately no time to take a look at the museum. The best time was around 16.30, since there was almost no one left. The big problem with this temple is the fact that foreigners have to pay so incredibly much more. As I'm a student, I got a discount of approximately 100k. Getting the student ticket turned out to be pretty difficult as I'd forgotten my student card. Luckily, the staff was very kind and gave me the discount anyway (after having shown several digital forms of proof of me being a student). The international ticket does include a beverage.Furthermore, there is free WiFi at the temple. Something that is great when wanting to order a Grab. I can highly recommend using Grab. A one-way drive cost us about 160k from the centre of Yogayakarta. I consider this very cheap since it's around 90 minutes driving. The Grab drop-off and pick-up point is at the BRI ATM just outside the gate.Another nice feature is the free audio tour.

There is a 15min walk from the hotel entrance to the temple and then some stairs to ascend (even the unfit can manage). There were loads of tourists already perched in their spots for sunrise (and by this time the sky was starting to light up). We chose to simply watch the sunrise - without phones/cameras/screens and it was serene. As soon as there as enough light we scurried to the Southern side of the temple to start photographing - we were literally the only ones there for a good 20min! We actually found there was plenty of space for good photos despite it was busy with tourists. At this point the temple emptied with tourists off to their next stop of to the hotel for breakfast.

"Coquitlam, Canada",5.0,"Carving scenes, Buddha statues & bell-shaped objects are what to see as you walk around the 9 or 10 levels of this temple which I would describe as more of a ""structure"" since everything is ""outdoors"" here (no indoor part whatsoever at this temple or in its immediate vicinity which is also something to keep in mind if you come on a rainy day); I would suggest to first go all the way up to the stupa on the top level (just about a 10-minute walk from the bottom of the temple structure), then go around the levels one-by-one as you make your way down (I think the tradition or protocol here is to go around each level ""3 times in the counterclockwise direction"").  Overall, I was ""quite impressed"" with the ""present state"" of this temple (given its age of 1,200 years or so since its building in about AD 800) where especially the carving scenes appear ""quite perfect"" (not like those at Angkor Wat where, if I remember correctly, those scenes alongside the corridors have, to some extent, ""faded"" over time); really the ""only thing"" that kind of reminds you this is an ancient site is these headless statues of Buddha (just some, not all of them) that you see beside or above as you walk around the levels (not too bad though compared to those at some temples of the Ayutthaya ancient city in Thailand).Also going hand-in-hand with the temple structure in its great shape (as mentioned above) is the well-maintained temple grounds that are ""quite spacious"" with beautiful lawns & paved walkways (saw some elephants too on the lawn at one area probably for rides around the surrounding countryside which you'll also see in ""all its beauty"" of green flat lands & some distant mountains when you look out from the levels of the Temple); and yes be sure to go through the multiple rows of souvenir shops just outside the temple grounds after leaving (there are also two small museums, one with a ship model & one with musical instruments, near the exit on the way out).There are two buses (no direct bus) to take to get here: first the transjogja bus 2B (I took it from the bus stop in front of Fort Vredeburg on the south end of the ""shopping street"" Jl. Malioboro) for about a half-hour ride to I believe its ""end station"" where you change to the bus called 'Cemera Tunggul' (the name on a side of the bus) for about a one-hour ride to the Borobudur Bus Station (which for sure is the ""end station"") from which it's just about a 5-minute walk to the entrance to the temple grounds.  And, there's the ""combo ticket"" with Prambanan (which is a group of six ancient Hindu temples also quite worthwhile although that site won't take as long as here) available for 500-something-thousand rupiah (as of last October when I visited), but there's only a 2-day period to do both temples, so you have to do them either on the same day or on two consecutive days.",2018-05-02,Solo,2017-10,canada,61.0666922,-107.991707

"Penang Island, Malaysia",5.0,Came at 6am where the sun was still rising. Sarongs are provided for those who're wearing shorts. Go 'round the back to ascend the temple as there are much lesser people. Do remember to use sunscreen as the sun is blazing in the morning without any clouds blocking. A guide would be very useful in learning the history and understanding the temple. This is something that i regretted not doing because there is so much to learn about the temple. Have a look at the museum as well. It's quite interesting despite not being very well-maintained.

"Singapore, Singapore",3.0,"This is a beautiful and quite unique historic temple near Jogja. Entrance is USD 25 per head for foreigners. It's USD 15 for children under 10 and older children can pay the same rate if they have student ids from their school. Before visiting you might want to consider a few things:1. It is just 1 building  (however beautuful) so it's poor value and really overpriced vs the extensive and lovely sites in Thailand and Cambodia. And of course India! 2. It is incredibly hot. For perspective I lived in UAE for 8 yrs (and was outdoors daily in summer in the afternoon - weird I know) and I now live in Singapore. I'm used to hot. This was crazy, scary hot. If you decide to go carry water, wet wipes, wear loose clothing ideally with full sleeves and ankle length clothing (there is a dress code so you are given a sarong if you wear shorts). Wear a hat / cap and sunglasses. And carry or hire an umbrella there. Yes, you will need the hat and umbrella and still swelter. 3. Otherwise go for sunrise. I believe the tickets are higher priced though and leaving the hotel at 3:45am had no appeal for me. We stayed in Jogja at The Phoenix but maybe if you stay in Borbodur you can go for this option. 4. You can spend max 2 hours there. Literally if you photograph and examine everything in the building. We left our hotel at 9am and covered Borbodur and a few surrounding temples in the same visit. The foreigners reception and rest rooms were clean and welcoming. They provide water and tea and coffee there. It's part of the entrance fee. We had our wonderful guide from the rather hilariously named Smailing Tours with us already from the hotel. The place was very, very crowded. It's practically impossible to get a picture of anything without a bunch of tourists bombing you. The temple itself is lovely and shaped like a stupa. The individual stupas have diamond shaped holes on the lower levels and square on the 2nd last level. The final dome shaped stupa is solid representing nothingness / salvation according to our guide. 2 stupas are open and the Budhas inside are visible. V unique and gorgeous.  V nice but maybe visit it before you go to Angkor to avoid feeling underwhelmed. Sorry to say that while Jogja /  Solo / Central Java is lovely, it really cannot compare with Angkor for sheer scale and variety.  All in all do visit if you are really into history and want to cover every unique temple out there. Otherwise you might just want to head to Bali.",2018-04-17,Family,2018-04,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992
"Noida, India",5.0,"To my mind, the Borobudur temple surpasses all other heritage architecture in SE Asia, with the exception of the Angkor Wat. Of course, having been hit by earthquakes, it has been reconstructed over time using old material and the old pattern. But that takes nothing away from its magnificence. To see the Borobudur temple fully, one needs to spend at least a full day here. Begin with sunrise, when there are quite a few people here - I went in early April (just before peak season) and found myself sharing space with least 100 people - that too at 5am. The temple is built in a pyramid design with a each level being smaller than the one it stands on. Punctuated by stupas and Buddhas - I am told there are 506 Buddhas here - too many to count. You get views of the surrounding countryside and Mount Merapi. As the sun rises, there is a gentle mist in some parts of the countryside.To see the sunrise: You need to pay IDR 450,000 per person - payable to the resort Manohara. You need to reach the place by 4:30am, make the payment and then make the ascent in darkness. The Manohara folks will give you a torch to help make your way in the darkness. The ticket also entitles you to some refreshment at Manohara after your visit is done. The refreshment is available till 9am.Be in place on the monument at most by 5:15am to see the gradually changing colours of the sky and the changing hues on the stupas of Borobudur. Once the sun is up by 6:15am, make your way downwards taking in the massive number of carved panels which ring the structure, one layer enveloping the other.If you understand Hindu mythology, the stories brought out by the panels will make sense. Otherwise, take a guide to walk you through and point out some of the key ones. This could work best if you come back to the place after the early morning visit. There are two museums close to the monument - one dedicated to the structure and the culture that gave it life and another - called the Samudra Raksha museum - which speaks of the maritime culture of Indonesia.Near these museums you will be accosted by various peddlers selling stone replicas of Borobudur. They will be persistent but if you walk back to the main monument and to Manohara, they will dropoff.",2018-04-15,Couples,2018-04,india,22.3511148,78.6677428
"Luzon, Philippines",5.0,"During planning my trip to Bali it was decided to spend one day in Yogyakarta first. The main reason was to see the 8 wonder of the world – Borobudur temple. Frankly speaking, after having visited all major temples on Bali, now I can openly tell that Borobudur temple is still number one in my personal rating :-)  of historical places in Indonesia. So if you are planning to visit Yogyakarta and Borobudur temple particularly, I hope the following tips will be helpful for you:1.	How to get? The easiest way was just to take a taxi. A cab from Yogyakarta to Borobudur temple (40 km from Yogyakarta) and Prambanan temple (18 km from Yogyakarta) and back to Yogyakarta costed us  USD 45 (all this time a driver was waiting us near each temple).  2.	Operating hours: 6.00 a.m. – 5.00 p.m. 3.	There is also a special pass from the Manohara Hotel to enter the monument early in the morning at 4.30 before the regular operating hours. Frankly speaking, that should be a wonderful opportunity  to avoid sunburn and overcrowded queues for climbing up the temple and especially annoying sellers of handicrafts.4.	Please note that it’s cheaper  to buy combinational ticket (for example we bought a ticket for Borobudur+Prambanan temples for RP540.000=USD40. The price for one temple only will be USD25). The price includes a complimentary drink (0,5ml of water). The ticket is valid within 2 days only. 5.	Do not repeat our mistake! If you want to see other temples near Yogyakarta, it is better to start from those ones and go to Borobudur afterwards. For example, I strongly recommend to visit Prambanan temple firstly (for example directly from airport) and only after that go ahead to Borobudur (for example the very next day). Otherwise, all other temples lost their beauty compared with Borobudur 6.	I strictly recommend starting your journey early morning for several reasons: (a) you will be lucky to avoid the hottest time, (b) there will be no so many people, (c) you will have an opportunity to visit several places during one day. 7.	You should take a cap/hat with you and it’s better to take an umbrella additionally, or you have an option to rent an umbrella for RP 10.000 on the entrance of the temple’s complex. In any case, be ready to spend several hours open air under ruthless heat.8.	Do not be surprised if locals ask you to make a thousand photos with them and with all the members of their family",2018-04-12,Couples,2018-04,philippines,12.7503486,122.7312101

There were less crowd early in the morning but that changed soon even as early as 9-10 am. the place it seems is also famous among locals, so it may get even more crowded on weekends/holidays.

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"And a plus factor of cutting through the centre of Yogya in utter quiet and seeing the wholesale markets as a reminder that some people really do get up and work hard real early. The coffee shop at the departure point is abuzz already as our driver gets our entry tickets (450k apiece) and takes us to collect torches and a map. Follow the neon signs for the temple sunrise and stroll happily to the temple steps. These start easy and gradually get steeper and a little more early morning challenging but nothing too strenuous. Presuming you are vaguely fit and can handle climbing about 9 flights of stairs. It's obvious where the main sunrise viewpoints are by the crowds already positioned. So it's find a good spot and wait. The valley was shrouded in mist and with perfect silhouette of Merapi in the distance and eerie other world feel. Spectacular views and we were blessed with a near perfect morning with a few clouds. Something a few who were back for a second chance had missed in the rain the day before. Others  the way down, enjoy a walk around each of the levels as the carvings become more intricate and detailed. Be careful to follow your map for the exit at sunrise (rather than the signs for exit which take you to the normal daytime exit at the opposite end). We did not and found the exit signs leading us through a maze of souvenir Market stalls (all closed) until a kind soul let us know we were wrong footed and we should follow signs to the hotel. The ticket price includes a breakfast snack and refreshments and a small souvenir (batik scarf for us) unexpected and welcome. Hand back your torch to the reception desk and receive your gift. I'd recommend that you wear decent sports shoes for the climb and a sweater or sweatshirt in case it's a tad cool.

"Bali, Indonesia",4.0,"This was my second visit to Borobudur Temple and, if you're travelling in Indonesia, it is a must-see.My last visit was in 1998, so a lot has changed! It is much more commercialised and busy these days (and in typical Indonesian fashion, not well managed). However, it is still a beautiful and magical temple.We arrived for sunrise. It's not necessary to go through Manohara Hotel to visit at sunrise - just check the sunrise time when you're planning your trip. Sunrise in February was 5.45am. Gates open to the public at 6am. You have time to get in and climb the stairs to the top by the time the sun has risen over the hills. (Manohara tours depart 4.30am and you will see nothing in the dark, not to mention it's overpriced!) Stay in town so you can wake up at 5am and walk to the temple easily (I recommend Saraswati Borobudur - see separate review).There were still quite a few people lined up waiting to enter at 6am and by 8am the temple is getting busy. Absolute horror were the large groups of school children on school outings - there were hundreds of them - climbing up, taking selfies, shouting and running. Really disrespectful and not interested in the temple at all. Don't know why they are allowed to do it. Try to get in and get out before they arrive!I would hate to visit in the middle of the day when it must be so overcrowded.",2018-03-12,Couples,2018-02,indonesia,-2.4833826,117.8902853

The drive itself was an ""e-ticket ride"", zipping through traffic with the police escort...with not a few very close calls.  We arrived at the site of Borobudur about midday and it was HOT.  Be prepared!!  The site is incredible, whether viewed from a distance or up close and personal.  The quality of stone carving (given 8th century technology) is amazing.  The site was extremely crowded the day were there, which made viewing problematic at times.  After spending two hours on/in the temple in the bright sun, we were exhausted (from the heat and the climbing required).  Our tour had lunch in a nearby restaurant.

Of all the temples I visited on Java this one had the most enthusiastic vendors. Well maybe Mendut came close. I pointed at some friends coming up the road and half a dozen vendors made a beeline and were on these new comers like flies to honey. Even saying, ""tidak terima kaseh"" (no thank you) doesn't dissuade them.

If you are interested in culture and history then this place is definitely worth a visit. Take enough time to see the grounds and climb all the steep steps until you are on the top because only there you see the full beauty of this temple. Also I suggest to take a guide, because there are so many interesting details to this temple, just walking around alone wont do it justice. Please be aware, there are quite a few steps until you are on the top, and some of them are rather high. If you take it easy and take the time you need, you will make it to the top, however if you have any kind of knee or leg issue, I think you might have problems with the higher steps. As this is an old temple the steps are not even or same height, they are all different and rather steep.  In regards of clothes, you will get a Sari at the entrance in case your clothing doesn't suit the rules.

The reliefs are beautiful (I recommend the Approach Guide on Borobudur to help interpret, along with various google-sourced sites). The atmosphere is lovely and powerful. The views from Borobudur are excellent. The views OF Borobudur are excellent. It is one of the best sites i've seen worldwide.With that said, definitely going to be a bit different if you're a white guy. I couldn't go more than a minute or two without being stopped for a picture or for a basic english conversation from some of the rural Indonesians, who apparently still believe a bog-standard basic white boy is anything noteworthy. Thus during busy periods it becomes a serious distraction, especially if you're trying to interpret some busy and complicated relief.

Borobudur was actually rediscovered by Sir Stanford Raffles, the founder of Singapore. Like Angkor Wat, it was originally in the midst of dense forest. What a privilege to visit such a wonderful ancient site.I liked taking pictures with the Buddha statues and the stupas at the top of the temple. Don't forget to look out for the views of the volcano located near the area.If possible, one should go during sunrise as this area gets very hot during the afternoon.

We and several others were picked up around 5am and were at Borobudur for the 6am opening time since there was no traffic at that time.We had looked at the public travel options but unlike getting to Prambanan, it was going to be quite time-consuming and a later arrival in the heat.We bought the combination-ticket with Prambanan which saved some on the very high entrance ticket prices.Besides it being a lot quieter so early, we really appreciated the much more pleasant temperature in the early morning. As it was quite hazy, the sunrise entry (with a hefty surcharge) would not have been worth paying extra for in our view. We were able to get lots of photos with few tourists around before the school groups and large family outings started coming at 7-7:30. We opted not to get a guide so one hour or so was enough to visit the temple for us and take in all the information available. We also visited the nice little museum with several older photos before exiting.Just trying to exit through the maze of souvenir stands was a fair effort and not much in the way of attractive souvenirs on offer.

"Jakarta, Indonesia",3.0,"I had visited Angkor Wat first before I visited Borobudur. I'm sorry to say that the visit to Borobudur was less rewarding experience than my visit to Angkor Wat for the following reason.In terms of the structure, both temples cannot be compared. Both are unique. Borobudur is of course older than Angkor Wat. The carvings are also different. So, it is not justified to compare the experience of visiting both temples from this angle.What caused my visit less rewarding was the fact that I visited Borobudur during Christmas holiday. We arrived at 7.30 (early by my standard 😋) only to find that the temple had been packed with people. What disappointed me more was the fact that the visitors (predominantly fellow Indonesians just like me) tended to show ignorant behaviours such as cutting lines and taking SELFIES and group photos wherever they desired without observing others' existence. For example, lots of people took selfies in the stairs (oh and with various attempts of pose---automatically taking longer time) causing long queue. I personally think taking selfies or group photos when others were queuing is so selfish.The selfie or group photo addiction was exacerbated by the fact that instead of enjoying the TEMPLE, lots of people liked to enjoy themselves by having a picnic at the hallway of the temple. Yep, a picnic where they laid a mat for sitting down and again taking group photos or selfies --- decreasing the space for others to walk through the hallway.Hey, some people wanted to visit the temple to enjoy the carvings. Not to take selfies or group photos.In sum, my disappointment is not in the Borobudur itself, yet in my unfortunate time of visit.",2017-12-28,Couples,2017-12,indonesia,-2.4833826,117.8902853

The Intricate carvings tells a lot of the quality of the sculptures and artists. However, the entry fee for foreigners is excessively high when you compare it with that in Angkor Wat (where you get similar temple complex but many more in number for a similar price). Even temples in India with similar intricate stone-carving work have a much less entry fee for foreigners. If you are splurging, then its fine. If you are on a budget, it may be better to go to Angkor Wat instead for better value for money. But Borobudur is definitely worth a visit for the quality of its stone carvings.

Henceforth, I would recommend taking a combined tour in which you share a minibus transport to get to both temples.

Buying the combined ticket is cheaper than visiting the two temples separately if you are intending to visit both.

We wanted to see the sunrise from the temple top as we learnt that this is an awesome view and should not be missed. Unfortunately due to cloud cover we could not see the sunrise. However in the early morning hours in soft sunlight, both the temple and the surrounding areas down the temple was simply unforgettable. The whole temple is huge and while going down from the top we could get a feel the vastness of this stunning temple. This temple was lying under volcanic ash and later discovered and restored. The restoration work done is excellent including the work done after volcanic eruption in 2010. From the base of the temple it looks almost like a pyramid. There are seven major levels in the temple and while going down we enjoyed the exquisite bas reliefs depicting the different phase of Buddha's life and stories from Jataka. Interestingly though it is a Buddha temple, there are many Hindu deities inscribed in the wall panels. Most of the figures and faces are not local unlike Ankor Wat but resembles features of Indians. Some of the faces are very similar  to frescoes of Ajanta cave in India.  The temple is very well maintained. It is always better to visit the temple in the morning and sunrise from the temple top should be attempted. A reasonably quick visit will take 4-5 hours.

It has three levels symbolic of Buddhist cosmology, the world of desire, the world of forms and the world of formlessness. It is a shrine to Lord Buddha and a place for Buddhist yearly pilgrimage from the base to the top. Built in the 9th centuries with 2672 relief panels, 504 Buddha statue and over two million stones blocks without cement or mortar but by interlocking together and remain strong although it was been neglected and abandon after the 14th centuries when majority of the pupils convert to Muslim. It was rediscovered in 1815 buried under the volcanic ash and in the 1970’s the UNESCO with the Indonesia Government worked together to restore Borobudur to its former stage which took a long eight years to complete. The structure has now become the treasures of Indonesia and the world largest and most complete ancient Buddhist reliefs in the world. If you have Cambodia Angkor Wat temple complex you able to compare the carving of Borobudur with the former. Although it is 300 years older than Angkor Wat the carving is finer and intricate detailed without much new blocks replaced than the Angkor Wat. In others words it is more original!Best way to visit is on foot and there are few options depends on what is your focus of visiting Borobudur. As Borobudur are best seen at dawn and sunset hours to see where the highlight of stone relief and the many faces of Buddha statue in silhouette.

If you are the house guest of Manohara hotel is 275,000 IDR. Ticket are sold during the day of visit at Manohara Hotel, just tell the security you are coming for the sunrise tour and he will show you the ticket counters.

"Manila, Philippines",5.0,"After visiting Angkor Wat some years ago, I needed to visit what many consider as her ""sister temple"" ... the Borobudur Temple, in Central Java, Indonesia. From Denpasar, Bali I flew to Yogyagarta ... a short flight of only about an hour and 30 minutes, stayed there for three days, and joined a day tour to the famous temple. The organizer picked me up from the hotel very early in the morning. We went to collect others who were joining the same tour.The van ride took us about one hour and 45 minutes to reach Borobudur. The view of the active Merapi volcano along the way was simply beautiful! The guide first took us to one of the eateries in the area (named ""Rambutan"") for a quick breakfast, and then gave us some instructions including the exact time by which we should be back to the same drop-off point.It's quite a long walk from the drop-off point to the temple proper. I met other tourists along the way, who were kind enough to take some of my photos. Finally I reached the temple and, wow, what a structure it was! The place was not yet that crowded when I got there since it was still rather early. Thus I was able to roam around quite comfortably.Borobudur is a 9th-century Buddhist temple (unlike its Cambodian counterpart, the Angkor Wat, which was originally a Hindu temple). It is the world's largest Buddhist temple! The Guinness Book of Records also says that it is the world's largest Buddhist archaeological site. It is also listed as a UNESCO Heritage Site.The structure consists of nine platforms ... six square and three circular ... topped by a central dome. It is decorated with thousands of bas-relief panels and hundreds of Buddha statues. The central dome is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues, each seated inside a perforated dome (called ""stupa""). Every single detail of it is not only an ideal spot for picture-taking, but is likewise rich in history and symbolism. In fact, the whole structure is like one giant Buddhist mandala, depicting Buddhist cosmology.When visiting the place, I suggest that you go there early to avoid the crowd and the heat. Also stay away from people selling guide books for the moment you entertain them, they won't let go of you until you buy their merchandise!

Unfortunately there was not much shade at the temple grounds, so do wear hats & bring lots of water. Plenty of steps to climb.  Fortunately there was not much crowd, we had many beautiful photos with no one in it. Unbelievable to think this temple is over 1000 years old, very impressive. My biggest complaint however is the exit out of the temple grounds, which involved over 1km of walking through repetitive craft & souvenir shops. Yes, over 1km of walking in the heat!!

The mist surrounding the forest around Borobudur at dawn gives it a beautiful mystic feel and makes the sunrise magical. It can get slightly cold in the morning, so dress warm.

"Cambridge, MA",5.0,"This is one of the most incredible places in the world and deserves several hours -- and spending time there is the key to avoiding frustration at the dawntime crowds.You should go at dawn -- the place is magical at that hour even if you are in the middle of a clicking army of visitors. But linger on after dawn and the crowds rapidly diminish. Walk down to the levels of extraordinary carvings illuminated by the strengthening sunlight and then go up again to be amidst the bells and you will be captivated in a way never to be forgotten.I'd very strongly recommend staying at least one night in the area rather than trying to come in and you from Yogya the same day. If you do that, you can return to your guesthouse or hotel after seeing the main temple, rest a bit, and then go out and see other temples and villages also. The area is attractive and it is easy to find someone to take you round.Public transport to and from Yogya is readily available although it starts and ends at an obscure bus terminal to the north of Yogya city. Alternatively get a car from Gojek or Uber -- although as I found there is sometimes no availability and you may have to take the bus anyway (no big deal!)Just don't rush.

Very disappointing, there were too many clouds and we never really got to see a sunrise. Plus there were like a 100 tourists there every one wanting to snap the exact same picture so lots of waiting and some people even asking others to move. Remember this is before the place even opens up to regular tourists at 6am. The Temple it self is wonderful and since we had looked forward to seeing it we were very happy that we got to visit it finally. We spent an hour there post the ""sunrise"" and as the ticket price included tea/coffee at the Manohara hotel next door we ended the visit with some coffee. I would not suggest a sunrise visit to anyone - please check the weather conditions and even then it was too crowded and you would really have to try hard get good pictures.

,1.0,"I didn't do the sunrise tour so can't comment on that. After 18 months of travelling and many different countries, this ranks as the number 1 attraction for worst value for money.I stayed in Yogyakarta and to begin with the journey there and back is just an awful part of it. Then to depart with  325,000 RP to enter is really taking the p###.I've fortunate enough to have gone to Bagan and Angkor and there really is no comparison.How they can justify that price admission is anyones guess.You will be struggling here to make the visit last  2 hours. I've just left the water castle in Yogyakarta and as an attraction, regardless of cost that place is far more interesting ( shame can not get detailed map ?? )The water castle being over 20 times cheaper just highlights how hard it is to justify the entrance fee at borobudar. If your on a budget and are in 2 minds about seeing this place, my advice is don't bother and save your money for something much more worthwhile.As in the title, this is right at the top of the list for the worst value for money attraction in 18 months of travelling.I'm aware that you can get a discounted ticket with Prambanum. Maybe with the joint ticket and the lottery of a sunrise it may well be worth it.Somehow I doubt it",2017-08-21,Solo,2017-08,,,

,5.0,"To be honest, it is underwhelming compared to other temple sites such as Angkor Wat. But still it is a great place to visit and enjoy.For sunrise, you could visit an alternative place called Punthuk Setumbu (nirvana sunrise) for 15k IDR (double for foreigner), which cost a lot cheaper than Borobudur. The sunrise in Borobudur is via a hotel entrance and 400k+ IDR, and I didn't go for that.If you came by bike, park it outside of the compound and walk in. I came during the National day (17 August) and it was heavily discounted from 40k to 10k IDR. Foreigner's price was 20 USD. Why the huge difference?? Is this a rip-off?? The answer is ""No"", most of the locals earn 300 USD a month, can't expect to charge them the same.I came to this place 10+ years ago and now I feel that it is way more structured and convenient. Grab your tickets from the local or foreigner booths. Go in, choose whether you need a guide. Walk 100m on a nice clean path and Borobudur temple sighted from afar.The structured and statues started to get better maintenance, as it was rocked by couple of earthquakes years ago. Enjoy the sight, do some photo taking with some poses. Do not climb, damage or remove anything from site.If you need any cheap shirts, you may do so after the exits. Ignore the touts near the exits and walk to the nice covered compound with stores/stalls. Some shirts are priced at 100k for 6/7 pieces. The locals are not pushy and nice, treat them with respect and hoard those shirts and souvenirs. This place is huge, so walk some more to less crowded stalls, you may get cheaper deals.",2017-08-18,,2017-08,,,
United Kingdom,4.0,"Borubador I have long wanted to see Borobudur and was excited when the opportunity to visit finally presented itself. I rented a car and driver and set off from Yogyakarta around 8.15am and was there by 9.30am and arrived just ahead of bus loads of tourists but not early enough to avoid them. As you enter the complex you are assailed by hawkers trying to sell junk and tat. To be fair they leave you along with a simple but firm NO!.You are the presented with two signs one directing Indonesians to a ticket office and another directing Foreigners to a separate ticket office. If you are not Indonesian then be prepared to be ripped off by yet another example of outrageous price differentiation. Non Indonesians will pay more than 10 times what Indonesians will pay. I find this type of pricing structure outrageous and such a scheme in Europe would be roundly and rightly criticised.I bought a joint ticket at $40 which allowed me to visit both Borobudur and Prambenan. Again the price in dollars is converted to Rupiah at the sites exchange rate and is odd as I have signs all over Indonesia which suggest that Rupiah must be the currency used. Why use dollars when the country has a perfectly satisfactory and exchangeable currency.Ticket secured you are provided with a sarong which must be worn. This is after all a religious site. You then pass through checks including airport style checks that are ineffective. You then enter the grounds.It's about 1km from the ticket office to the steps of The Temple. I climbed the steps to the top along with now many hundreds of others. There were so many people that it was difficult to take photographs without some getting in the way. There is also very little shadeDespite the masses it was rather magical and I spent 90 minutes wandering around taken pictures whenever I could. Someone had a drone and I have to say these are more of a nuisance than selfie sticks and should be banned from all tourist sites. They are intrusive and irritating with an incessant buzzing which destroys the atmosphere.The exit from the Temple is not the same route as you enter and at the end of a long path you return your sarong. You can go to the museum which I did but it was not very well laid out and rather dull. It could be so much better and indeed for the entrance fee should be magnificent and air conditioned! It was interesting to read about the history of the site and its many refurbishments. I left wondering how much of what I had seen was original. As I left I passed a small fish pond filled with Koi carp struggling to swim and survive in very shallow water. The pond was being refilled but several larger fish were floundering on their sides unable to swim. It was unpleasant and wholly unnecessary.Following the exit signs I made my way back to the car through a market selling T shirts and souvenirs. It was huge and took ""exiting via the gift shop"" to a whole new level.I was pleased I went and pleased to have seen Borobudur. I would not however return and think that so much more is required for the outrageous entrance fee charged to foreign tourists.",2017-08-18,Family,2017-08,united kingdom,54.7023545,-3.2765753

"Colombo, Sri Lanka",5.0,"...because when we got up there, soon after the gates opened, it was just as I had read in a review- we were treated to a view that was a magical marriage between the man made and the  natural! I am not a great photographer and it is an accomplishment when I manage take a photo without decapitating the people posing for it, but even I managed to get these nice  photos of the dark stupas juxtaposed against a  colourful sky!  I could have spent a day at the top, basking in the peaceful feeling surrounding it and drinking in the beautiful scenery, imagining what it would have looked like in its hey day! The entrance ticket at the public gate is priced at IDR 325k for an adult and 195k for children up to 12. That includes a bottle of water-very useful after climbing to the top! One could hire the service of an English speaking guide for IDR 100k. The guides were waiting at the ticket validation point when we visited. Our guide Trishno was polite and friendly. He explained that the temple was built 1200 years ago with volcanic rock cut into interlocking shapes. No cement, glue or other binding agent had been used to connect the stones in the initial construction, but during the restoration in recent years they have used them in some places. The lack of binding material allows the stones some play during earth quakes and the locking system ensures the stones settling back into place afterwards. The temple had initially served as a place of learning for Buddhist monks. The way back to the exit (after descending  the temple rock) is a bit of a labyrinth through a market of handicraft, food stalls and other things, and it was just opening when we were leaving.We needed to get some money changed at the base for the taxi. There were several ATMs close by and we were told just one currency exchanger. He though was closed at the time we went there (around 8.30 am). We easily found a taxi to take us back to the hotel. There were also mopeds for rental. This is a place I will always be glad I visited, and encourage one to visit for the magical feeling one  experiences at the top, I am sure will forever be remembered!",2017-08-05,Family,2017-08,sri lanka,7.5554942,80.7137847

Add to that all of the carvings, the many many stupa, and the fact that that whole thing was lost in the jungle for a long time and it is one impressive place to see.One benefit of the sunrise entrance is that you are climbing up the steep steps in the cool morning air.  Also, while the sunrise is popular there are far fewer people there than later in the day.  I suggest staking out a good position as early as you can for photographs and be close to an edge otherwise people will sit in front of you.On week days, they place gets a lot of students on field trips.  On my last visit, there were probable more than a thousand student wandering about within a couple hours of opening.

Once there ignore all the hawkers and come out of the station and walk 10 minutes to the ticket gate. A combined ticket good for two days to both Prambanan and Bororudur is available for the rip-off rate of $40 US. I say this because the ticket price seems to go up every two months and only for foreigners. Indonesians pay 30,000. Not a friendly way to treat tourists. Once inside (sarongs are issued arbitrarily to some tourists in shorts or short skirts, not men apparently or everyone dressed that way.

Stayed at nearby hotel to avoid the journey from the city as we have a 7 year old with us. The tour from Manohara with a guide for our group of 4 was totally worth it. They provide torchlights which was sufficiently bright for us and my children and ourselves totally enjoyed walking around the temple with the guide and later without the guide(to the museum etc). We had a teabreak in between and returned to the temple to explore further. This temple has been restored quite a bit since our last trip and makes it easier to climb, walk around. Lots more restrictions due to efforts to keep the statues etc from further deterioration, but I am glad they are doing this. The museum is worth a visit if you are keen to know more about the restoration efforts. We do understand the Malay language so it did make it easier for us to talk to the person who was sitting in that particular section where they showed photos and other displays about the restoration.

Entry is via Manohara Hotel at 4.30am and the entrance fee is 450,000 per adult. We were provided a torch as it was pretty dark for the walk from the hotel to the temple entrance. There were several security check along the way. Once we reached the entrance of the temple, the steps leading all the way to the top were pretty steep and uneven. Once at the top, the whole place was pretty tranquil with exception to the occasional prayer call. The best view for the sunrise would be facing Gunung Merapi and naturally it would be packed with people searching for the best spot to catch the sunrise. The temple is massive and each level tells a story with its cravings on the wall. We took our time exploring each level of the temple once the sun was up. The temple was not overly crowded at that time as it was still early and most of the sunrise crowd was gone by the time we reach the lower level.

We started at 7:30 am , stopped on the way at some place to buy our tickets which was INR 300000 per head after getting a senior's discount of INR 25000 and reached the place at 8:30 am.Our driver guided us to the entrance gate where each of us got a drink voucher - either for a bottle of water or tea.  Those who wanted tea had to finish it before entering. We carried our bottles of water with us.We started our walk toward the temple through a beautiful park with manicured plants and green trimmed lawn.   As the weather was very good - not  hot - we did not have to buy any umbrella from the umbrella vendors who were everywhere.. Along the way we took photos of the temple from different distances and angles.  The temple is spectacular.  It has nine platforms and a total of about 500 statues of Budha some of which have been damaged.  There are other intricate Indian like sculptural work all around the walls of the nine platforms.  The steps to the different platforms are quite steep for which we decided not to venture beyond the second platform.The grounds are quite expansive with trees providing shade to the visitors. There are two museums - the second museum is about the spice trade that brought people from the West to Indonesia and one of the ships that came here was named Borbodur  after which this place was named. There is a beautiful replica of the ship in this museum. The temple which was built in the 8th century is now a world heritage site declared by UNESCO and is undergoing repair and maintenance.

"Aurora, Canada",4.0,"It’s not hard to get into temple overload in this part of the world, so we were cautious about booking a tour to yet another temple. This one sounded a bit special, though, and the two-hour drive from our cruise ship port of Semarang would give us a chance to see some of Java, too.Indeed, the slow drive through towns and villages, past rice fields, rubber plantations and volcanoes was fascinating.What made Borobudur Temple special to us was its size and history. We saw no other temple anything like it in our tour around SE Asia. Our guide explained how it had been built in the 700 and 800s, but then damaged and buried by volcanic ash. It was discovered in the 1800s and the long, painstaking process of unearthing and restoring it begun. As we climbed to each level, we marveled at the intricate carvings in each stone and at how many of the stones had been reassembled in their correct position in what would have been a massive 3D jigsaw puzzle at the reconstruction stage..

"Adelaide, Australia",5.0,"Borobudur Temple the largest Buddhist monument in the world, was built between 780AD and 840AD, measures 123 metres x 123 metres, with six square levels of corridors with bas-reliefs.  There are three circular levels, which have 72 perforated stupas, each containing a Buddha statue within, this is then crowned by a large stupa, making the height of the temple 29 metres.  There are a staggering 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues, as if that is not impressive enough, it was built with no binding agents such as mortar etc.  The temple is built like a three dimensional mandala, which symbolises the universe in Buddhism.  This design cannot be appreciated when visiting, only aerial images give a true picture of this brilliant piece of architecture, (check online).  The temple was mysteriously abandoned sometime in the 1500’s and rediscovered in the early 1800’s buried under layers of volcanic ash.  We visited for the sunset and sunrise, as we did get a good deal on the tickets, with where we were staying.  The sunset was much more peaceful with around twenty people, whereas the sunrise, as serene as that sounds, wasn’t.  The sunrise will be a lifelong memory, not because of the sunrise itself, it was the walk to the temple and the first 30 minutes on top of the temple.  We were staying in a nearby hotel and walked to the temple at 4.30am in the dark.  With torches in hand, fog all around and the call to prayer coming through loud speakers, it was all a bit surreal.  We were joined by a couple of others on the silent, long trek up the steps, at the top there were only five of us, sitting patiently and quietly waiting for the sun, as slowly more and more people arrived, by sunrise the temple was overrun.  Stick around for 1-1½ hours after sunrise, as the crowd rapidly thins out, we stayed until 10.30am.Borobudur is a truly amazing structure, whether visiting during the day, sunrise or sunset it will be unforgettable.  If undecided about sunset or sunrise, personally if ever going again, it would be sunset, as it was more peaceful which seems more befitting.",2017-07-14,Friends,2017-06,australia,-24.7761086,134.755

It also was noticeable the respect shown to the structure by many. It is a lot of steps to the top and down so if any physical issues sit back and watch.   The hawkers both arriving and leaving somewhat annoying but part of the scene and very smart the diverting you to a maze of markets as the only exit. I must admit a polite but stern tidak stops any  harassment.The tainted comment earlier related to tourists pay 8  times a locals entrance fee.

I cannot imagine with sunset or sunrise actually it might be wordless. The temple has been managed through years and even around it is so much better now.3-What despite me is the lack of informations about what we are visiting, you just walk everywhere and you dont really understand what you are looking for until you visit the museum but it is too late then. And even it lack of inagination from government and unesco they could do so much better to improve comprehension, recreate discovery....In add everything is not in english so why we pay more? But at least there is a good effort about it.4-The worst point about this is are we visiting a temple, house of spirit and respect, calm or are we among human animals who doesnt care, climb the stones without respect, yell all the time? It is not only in indonesia but i was ashamed to see a so old building not respected like this.

"Melbourne, Australia",5.0,"A really wonderful place to visit, up there with Angkor though obviously just one temple rather than a complex. The best way to get here is to rent a scooter, really easy to get here in just over an hour. We skipped sunrise but got here early at around 9am. Later on as we left around 11am the crowds were gathering. I don't think it is worth if for the sunrise unless you pay the extortionate fee to get in early. Once again, as with many places in Asia if you are not a local you pay a crazy price, which is getting tiresome to be honest as we don't do that in Europe.

Because of their engineerunity we have the chance to win experience what they built. My family and I were dropped by our guide at about 6am after sunrise. There were only few visitors. We felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. We hired an onsite guide that took us on a tour for couple hours. He was very informative and explained a lot of info about the place, too much for me to absorb in such a short time. If you are in Jogja, you have to come here to see this wonder. A quick comment about the place, the place has western style toilet . For some that don't like to squad, no worries here. Also there are hotels nearby that you can book which offer sunrise tour if you want to go before sun up. And if you want to save some money, buy the combo tickets for this temple and the other famous Prambanan temple.Lastly one negative that I don't like, vendors come inside the park and pester you to buy souvenirs.

"Chino Hills, CA",5.0,"This is an amazing temple, and I would rate it only second to Angkor Wat in Siem Reap.  First I recommend to everyone to NOT do the sunrise tour.  The reason is when the sun comes up, it is still foggy and dark.  You don't actually even see the sun.  If you come exactly when they open at 6am and make your way up to the top within the first 15 mins or so, you'll get the beautiful sunrise shot that you find all over the internet.  I also highly suggest to come right at 6am because there isn't too many people yet, so taking great pics without people in them is much easier.  I would say between 6am to 7am, the lighting is perfect for some great photos.  I'm a professional photographer, so I know what I'm talking about.  Keep in mind, I visited in the middle of June, the sunrise time was around 5:40am when I visited.  The temple itself is beautiful and gigantic.  There are also some great photo opportunity surrounding the temple.  The whole complex is very large, well kept, and would be an amazing location for a photoshoot.  Expect to spend about 1-2hours here at least.  When I purchased the ticket, I bought the combination ticket along with Prabanan Temple as well to save money.  The ticket is valid for 2 days, so even if you are not going to Prabanan the same day, it will save you money if you purchase the package when you go to Borobudur.",2017-06-17,Solo,2017-06,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882
,5.0,"In June2016,I planned to visit one of the most popular Relief in Jogjakarta,Central Java. To satisfy my inner Shangri-la's desire and with the assistance from our tour agent TOMO AND NANANG of JAVANA TRAVELCAFE, I then gathered my courage and set forth with my old dad. I had earlier booked MANOHARA HOTEL MAGELANG,which was located just besides the Borobudur Temple and within walking distance. According to the hotel's regulations,those guests staying there would enjoy free entrance fees,regardless the frequency of visits to the temple.The sightings here had provided SUNRISE AND SUNSET VISITS. Local inhabitants  were free of charge on visits, whereas foreigners had to pay US20 per visit. There was no mini mart selling groceries,but there was one outlet selling bottled/tinned drinks as well as ice creams; others including one roll of stores selling souvenirs and textiles and some vendors were canvassing sales around the ticketing entrance; they even sold umbrellas on rainniy days. We stayed three nights in the hotel. There was a restaurant close by,providing foods and  drinks  at guests' choices; their food qualities were acceptable and prices reasonable. Hotel attendants were polite and helpful. During our stays, we had visited the temple eight times. In the morning, it was quite misty and we were also welcome by the morning breezes, blowing in from the jungles nearby. There were visitors from other Asia and  Australia countries,including some European tourists who were enrouting via Australia back to their home lands. But majority of the visitors were muslims. Even though Indonesia had a large ratio of population being muslims,yet, their turn outs had been friendly, despite stepping on a building with entire different backgrounds  in respect of religions and  cultures. This finding had really inspired me to a great extend! On one occasion, my dad had noticed that a muslim lady had had difficulty in walking up to an upper level of the temple,he automatically offered her a lift. At first, that lady refused and said it was her first time to come up here. My dad therefore told her that it was his first time too. Being hesitatating for a while, that lady finally had accepted my  dad's aid. What a break through amid differences in relation to religions cultures and foreigners in particular! Later on, when we prepared to leave, we had again met that lady, who just sat there without proceeding further. She told us she was real tired. We said goodbye to her and made our way to our hotel. In the morning, many of the visitors had taken the sunrise view. Apart from those who were interested in shootings, especially focusing on the  sunrise in the misty morning,some of them were either chanting or practicing meditation ; some visitors were even walking around the temple while chanting, and continued to upper levels as well. The whole environment had been so serene, in that there was no exchange in conversation at all! All the visitors were just enjoying their very moments, without expressing a single word. Just enjoyed the peacefulness and harmony from  the surrounding atmosphere. I presumed that most of them had been charmed by the serenity and blissfulness which would have solidified their thoughts, such that they were all focusing on the amazing sceneries from near to far, as if they had been spelled bound, hoping to embrace the mountain tops and the sky above. Was not this the Shangri-la platform for us to pursue? On the third day afternoon, we chose an open area with a broad view of the temple in front. We sat on the grassy ground and enjoyed the serenity of the surrounding environment, wherein visitors had come and gone; at times there were laughters spreading out and travelled from near to afar. This was the place where you could gain peace and harmony. While doing meditation, I felt some objects were flying around. I was so tempted and opened my eyes to find the outcome. So amazing to me, they were dozens of dragonflies in golden color! Was I in the Alice's Wander Land? These beings were flipping their wings and circling us twice before departed. On the fourth day morning before we checked out from hotel, we ascended the temple compound, and found a suitable place to do meditation. The grassland was wet due to raining last night. We put some sitting mats on the ground, to ensure we could sit there comfortably. During the course of practice, I noticed there were some objects flying and moving around. This time, I opened my eyes and found out they were some flies in golden color! What a legend to tell? Our visit was just after the Wisak Day and the Buddhist there had already celebrated their events, in which five thousand pieces of lanterns written with good wishes and blessings had been released, as I was told  by the tour agent afterward. So long and I also hoped all living beings in this universe would lead a peaceful and healthy life, and to attain their inner peace in particular!Om,OM......From: Ms Tam, 16June 2017",2017-06-16,,2017-06,,,

"Taipei, Taiwan",5.0,"I joined a tour to travel from Jakarta to Ubud, Bali for two weeks. And for me, Borobudur Temple is indeed my favorite place in the whole trip (together with Mt. Bromo). It is indeed a magic place and the atmosphere is mesmerizing.Unfortunately, our tour arrived at mid-morning and this period happened to be the beginning of school holiday in Java. By 9am, there are high school students everywhere. It feels quite overcrowded. However, this is a large complex with several levels, so it was not hard to find a quiet corner to enjoy its serenity, briefly.Though Borobudur Temple is not listed as ""attractions/things to do"" under Yogyakarta (because it is not inside the District of Yogyakarta but in East Java Province), usually it is easiest to base in Yogya and make a day trip here.

"Bangkok, Thailand",5.0,"I've done Angkor Wat and Bagan, but this was something else entirely. There is only one time to go there, and that's for sunrise. The temple and grounds are perfectly maintained and immaculate. It doesn't get the package-tour gaggles of loud, obnoxious tourists, at least not yet, so it really feels still like quite a personal experience. You have a semi-active volcano with the sun rising above it, revealing misty mountains to one side and green grounds to the back...stone relief carvings at all levels of the temple, and almost 500 small stupa to navigate. Just an amazing place. But....it's also an expensive place. At US$35, it's more expensive than a full week of temples in Bagan, and almost the same as a 3-day pass in Angkor Wat. And the other temples in the area are the same -- $25+ for any temple you visit. So Yogjakarta is ridiculously overpriced. For two temples and a taxi we spent about $75 each. And the other temples are kind of Meh...So if I were doing it again, I'd just blast through there for two days, see Borobudur, and move on.

It was restored in the 1970's with help from UNESCO. It consists of nine stacked platforms - 6 square and 3 circular with a large central dome at the top. It truly is an amazing sight and I imagine that it would be even more magnificent if viewed from above. It was crazy busy the day we were there as a Buddhist holiday was being prepared for two days  hence. We walked around all of the levels and took time to look at the hundreds of detailed statues and sculptures which represent Buddhist teachings along with images of Javanese life. The mixing of indigenous ancestor worship with Buddhist teachings is evident and fascinating. We saw many Buddhist monks worshiping which added to the spiritual nature of this site. It's hot there with little shade. The manicured, park-like area surrounding the temple is in itself, very beautiful.

Me and my wife decided not to go for the sunrise tour (to save the effort of waking early as we were not staying at Manohara) and just booked a driver to visit the place around 9am in the morning. Takes around 1 hour plus to reach from Yogyakarta town. Purchased the Borobudur/Prambanan combined ticket for USD $40 per pax (520,000 rp) as we were planning to visit Prambanan in the afternoon. Price on Wikitravel is not updated as it's still stated as $32 per pax. Pretty steep price considering that local adults only need to pay 40,000rp per pax. And the price seems to go up every year. The temple complex itself is impressively big considering it was built in the 9th century. Takes around 1.5 to 2 hours to complete walk around the different levels of the temple complex (includes plenty of time for photographs).

For comparison: you can have a local dinner in Jogja for 50.000, for 2 people.2. As a western looking person, you don't have any chance to enjoy the temple during day time as it's crowded with Indonesian School classes. It seems that the kids are encouraged by their teachers to take as many photos with, and of, western tourists as possible. This is simply annoying and ruined the whole experience for us. We simply said ""no photos"" at some point because we were really starting to be pissed off, but they don't care. They seriously ""hunt you down"" for photos. So if you decide to go, go there in the early morning.3. When you leave the site, you have to exit through a different direction compared to where you walked in. You're led through 1 km (not joking) of markets where you're asked to buy something. Summary: This is mismanagement at it's best!! The management should seriously re-think everything, because if they keep going this path, western tourists will no longer visit this place in the near future.

We waited until about 7.30am where the sun appear out of the clouds. Borobudur is really an amazing heritage complex which is very well maintained considering the long history. A must see place if anyone were to be in Yogyakarta. We were there one day a ahead of the Vesak day to avoid the crowd.

We were very lucky to have had a very knowledgeable guide who answered our many questions and gave us great insight into the history of the place.  It certainly is a very unique structure and we felt well worth our effort to get there.  Go early as it can get extremely hot by mid day.

"Bengaluru, India",5.0,"Takes about an hour to reach Borubodur from the city. The entry fee is really steep for foreigners!! But I guess the well maintained gardens surrounding the property and the restoration & maintenance work at the temple would require such level of entry costs. Also since it is a UNESCO heritage site and popular tourist location. There is a separate entry for non-Indonesians. The entry fee includes 1 complimentary beverage (tea/coffee or bottle of water). There is also a licensed guide available for a nominal fee.The temple complex is really impressive. There are well maintained gardens surrounding the temple. From afar it looks relatively easy to climb, but as you start working your way thru the different levels upto the top, it can get tiring due to the heat. Our guide was quite tired as well that day! We took breaks at each level spending time to take photos before proceeding to the next level. The view from top level with the stupas and Buddha statues is awesome.If you go for the sunrise view the cost is almost double, but we decided to just go later in the morning since the view is still awesome and less crowded.

"Puchong, Malaysia",5.0,"The Borobudur Temple Compounds is one of the greatest Buddhist monuments in the world, and was built in the 8th and 9th centuries AD during the reign of the Syailendra Dynasty. The monument is located in the Kedu Valley, in the southern part of Central Java, at the centre of the island of Java, Indonesia.The main temple is a stupa built in three tiers around a hill which was a natural centre: a pyramidal base with five concentric square terraces, the trunk of a cone with three circular platforms and, at the top, a monumental stupa. The walls and balustrades are decorated with fine low reliefs, covering a total surface area of 2,520 m2. Around the circular platforms are 72 openwork stupas, each containing a statue of the Buddha.The vertical division of Borobudur Temple into base, body, and superstructure perfectly accords with the conception of the Universe in Buddhist cosmology. It is believed that the universe is divided into three superimposing spheres, kamadhatu, rupadhatu, and arupadhatu, representing respectively the sphere of desires where we are bound to our desires, the sphere of forms where we abandon our desires but are still bound to name and form, and the sphere of formlessness where there is no longer either name or form. At Borobudur Temple, the kamadhatu is represented by the base, the rupadhatu by the five square terraces, and the arupadhatu by the three circular platforms as well as the big stupa. The whole structure shows a unique blending of the very central ideas of ancestor worship, related to the idea of a terraced mountain, combined with the Buddhist concept of attaining Nirvana.The Temple should also be seen as an outstanding dynastic monument of the Syailendra Dynasty that ruled Java for around five centuries until the 10th century.The Borobudur Temple Compounds consists of three monuments: namely the Borobudur Temple and  two smaller temples situatued to the east on a straight axis to Borobudur. The two temples are Mendut Temple, whose depiction of Buddha is represented by a formidable monolith accompanied by two Bodhisattvas, and Pawon Temple, a smaller temple whose inner space does not reveal which deity might have been the object of worship. Those three monuments represent phases in the attainment of Nirvana.The temple was used as a Buddhist temple from its construction until sometime between the 10th and 15th centuries when it was abandoned. Since its re-discovery in the 19th century and restoration in the 20th century, it has been brought back into a Buddhist archaeological site.",2017-05-03,,2017-04,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823

"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",5.0,"A UNESCO heritage site, Borobudur temple is the epitome of architectural magnificence and cultural reflection from 9th century AD. There would seldom be any reason to visit Jogja if not for Borobudur alone. As a traveller's guiding tip, I would mention below what worked for me. The place and the compound is huge. Acres of land. Maintainance cost is good as well when the annual footfall is in the range of 5 million but mostly Indonesians. Yet there are avenues to spend or rather indulge if you want to. A couple of hotels around could arrange private early morning or sunrise trips or even elephant rides or night camping during full moon. That all is luxury. The sight during noon as well is amazing. The carving on the walls are clearly visible and the risk of paying but missing the exact sunrise experience due to clouds is zero. So, early morning visit and additional expenses are your choices to make. What is recommended is to take the guide after purchasing ticket. There is a combo offer for Borobudur plus Prambanan temple entries which you can buy to get some discount on total fee. If you are a foreigner, you have a different queue for tickets and your price includes choice of water bottle (small), tea or coffee. Before reaching there, check the reference of parking where your vehicle is parked to avoid searching when you come out as entrance and exit are different. As a mark of developing nation, several people would be found selling knock-knacks while you are approaching temple compound. Simple avoid eye contact and keep moving. Bring your own selfie stick or be ready to pay more if you realise you forgot it at the hotel!Once inside, the guide's fee is 100k IDR for 1 hour and 150k for 2. We insisted on 1 hour and we got Mr Midi. Nice chap and irrespective of his religious believes, he had sound knowledge of Buddhist culture and history, a lot learned by his experience as guide too as he has not been to either India or Nepal to verify the references of Jataka Katha on the walls of Borobudur temple. The guide will give you a brief on the history of the site. Once you start the tour there remains an option of taking train to the foot and then there are several stairs to climb. Forgot the exact numbers mentioned by the guide. It may scare or tire you just by watching the crowd and number of stairs and areas to walk. But there plays the trick of the guide. Mr Midi took us via a side entrance avoiding  the crowd completely. The view was miraculous throughout. There are stairs on different sides too. We never climbed two levels in a go. We moved through the west-facing side to avoid sun and walk in shade. With all the stories, discussions, photoshoot and scenary around we never realised we reached the top without feeling a bit tired. It is a place to sit and immerse yourself in introspection, at the top of the temple, a kind of surreal peace prevails when thinking you are abode the library of knowledge. We then climbed down and from the rear of the temple where there is a board of UNESCO, clicked photos of the whole structure. The guide leaves you there. We easily had spent more than 1.5 hours and therefore tipped the guide separately for 30k IDR. The return trip from the temple to parking is arduous due to long snake-like passage through lanes with shops on both sides. It could get on your nerves if you are hungry or thirsty. If you want to buy anything, bargaining is recommended. Borobudur statues of stone are available with both Buddha inside or without. Do not pick the one with Buddha inside casually as the lower part may accidentally separate, fall and break leading you to pay for it.Again and overall, with all the cobwebs around, it is one of the most recommended landmarks to see in entire south-east Asia.",2017-04-23,Couples,2017-04,united arab emirates,24.0002488,53.9994829

But even with the clouds we needed half-way a substantial compensation for the liquid lost by sweating. Therefore: dehydration has to be taken in account seriously.From the cultural point of view the temple complex is of course a must see and as earlier you are there the less crowdy (and the less hot) it will be. During noon time the complex empties again but for a good reason: it simply is too hot, to make the climb if you are not used to the climate.Exiting takes place through a conglomeration of stalls which you cannot bypass, an annoyance on regard to the inferior quality of souvenir and kitsch offered and the dignity of the monument.",2017-04-22,Couples,2017-02,germany,51.1638175,10.4478313

"Penang Island, Malaysia",5.0,"The nearby hotel we stayed in (Villa Borobudur) organised a VIP pass trip to the temple as part of the stay there.We went in late afternoon rather than the quieter dawn or dusk trips which are closed to all except prebooked excursions. As such it was busier but not oppressively so. The majority of visitors were from surrounding countries and so that meant groups of selfie stick obsessed teenage girls or tired parents sitting on the temple structures and ignoring the signs asking them not to do that.When you come out of the gardens at the VIP entrance and restaurant you are right at the base of the temple and its incredibly imposing – the climb looks a little daunting but taken at a casual level by level pace is easy enough for anyone to do.We had a guide who took us who was very passionate about the place and encyclopaedic in his knowledge – describing all of the scenes in the many reliefs and statues. He also recounted the many times the temple has been lost, ruined and restored and how the local Muslim people have helped repair and maintain it since it was abandoned centuries ago by the Buddhist monks.The views from the top of the temple are just amazing and in the late afternoon setting sun – really magical. In hindsight I would probably try the dawn sunrise trip to dodge the selfie hordes but can recommend it at any time.There are some VERY persistent souvenir hawkers in the grounds – ignore them and do not buy anything from them – the statuettes they are selling as carved basalt are just expensive moulded, painted concrete trinkets.",2017-04-17,Couples,2017-03,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823

The entrance gates and the stupas are all built with interlocking stones and each of the stupas have a buddha sitting inside. It's not an active Buddhist Temple anymore (meaning no ceremonies are held) however the place itself is a must visit. I did a solo trip (managed to find a local guy to take me there on his motorcycle) and got in about 6:30 AM. Being a Sunday it was quite crowded at the main entrance however I figured out the best way to beat the crowd is to go around the temple and climb up using the alternate gates (east is the main one where everyone enters through).

We bought a couple of coffees and walked the easy 300m up some paved steps and set up the camera ready for the light to appear.   When the sun started to rise, the clouds around the temple became visible and gradually revealed the temple dome.  It is a great spot for the scenery and surrounding areas but we couldn't see much of the temple. We took the motorbike back down the hill to the Borobudur temple itself, approximately 3km away.  Easily parked 50m from the entrance and had some local food, Nasi Padang. We then went around the temple for an hour at around 7am, perfectly beating the throngs of people that arrived as we were leaving.

It takes about 45 mins to get to the temple from city centre.

We expected to come to a place steeped in history and have an experience underpinned by a sense of calm and tranquility typically associated with spiritual landmarks. Instead, the significance and meaning of the site was completely obscured by the endless stream of tourists both swarming up into the structures and hounding us for selfies. Don't get me wrong, the actual temple site is absolutely beautiful with stunning views and could be a wonderful place to come to reflect and learn more about the history of Jogjakarta and it's changing religious faces. It is just totally ruined by the overly tourist-driven approach to conservation (people are climbing all over and eroding all the structures) and the resulting complete lack of atmosphere. To top off what had already been a fairly hollow experience, at the foot of the temples we were treated to endless stalls selling identical tourist tat and a sad looking malnourished elephant chained in a gloomy barren paddock. Prambanan was marginally quieter, but left us with the same sense of disappointment.

To avoid crowding people while you are visiting this ancient temple, do come early as possible. Usually crowd will started to get more around 10am. Once you have reached the park, you need to pay USD20 as their entrance fees. However, they will not accept USD currency in the counter (my mistake for having the thoughts that I can pay them in USD). Before getting in the temple ground, you might need a local tour guide. You can hire them before entering the temple. As for the travelers that keen to take only photo without any information needed, you can read beforehand about the information online. Once you have reached the temple ground,  be extra careful of some section closure (workers might do some preservation in the temple walls). Beautiful artworks carved on the walls are magnificent and there are hidden stories about Buddhahood and Jataka tales. Local guides might be able to elaborate more details about it. Coincidentally, when I was at the highest point in the temple, there was a mediation classes was going on. Usually this will take place in the morning. Besides that, some of students (whom I believed to be University students) will try to get engaged with you. They wanted to improve their English language and if you are tired or you refused to get ""interviewed"" from them, you can always say no. Touching stones, climbing on the stupas in Borobudur are prohibited but somehow you may find people doing it. In case if the guards sees visitors are doing that, a loud announcement will be heard.On the way down, if possible you may want to avoid the local markets. Before I reached to their main exit, I was approached by local sellers whom were trying hard to sell their items. Just a reminder, if you bought something from one seller, the rest will keep on tailing you. A simple ""no"" might work out but this situation will not be a turn off point for your entire visit in this wonderful temple.",2017-03-05,Solo,2017-02,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823

On the day I went, the overwhelming majority of the tourists appeared content on climbing to the top and getting the requisite selfie.  However, there are other parts of this structure that few tourists seemed interested in—the walkways around each of the platforms.  These have 1,500 or so relief panels that tell the story of the Buddha.  This is where I spent most of time.  The views of the surrounding countryside also make this a worthwhile trip.  There were many kids on the day I went.  They seemed to have a lot of fun running around in the corridors and on the stairways of this great temple.  There other features at this complex as well.  You can get photographed with a large albino python or an owl.  There is also a museum and a bookstore.

We did the sunrise Borobudur where you are driven to a hill and see the sunrise and then drive to the temple (We did this with Kresna tours but it was overpriced and then still had to pay for entry to the hill which we thought was included).  However you could also do a sunrise tour within the temple. I would recommend getting there early as it gets busy very quickly an hour or so after sunrise.  Best way to visit would probably be to get a taxi, if there is more than one of you, to drive you there so you are not limited for time and then get a taxi back to where you are staying.

However, if you are not Asian you will repeatedly be asked for selfies by adults and children alike. They seem more interested to get a selfie with you than of the temple itself.

That area is the centre of Plantation of this favourite fruit in Java island. The driver was very friendly and speaks English.  It costs 550000 rupiah for the transport and the short tour to GunungMerapi. We stayed at Manohara hotel because it's nearest to the temple and day pass is provided with the room. We can reenter the temple anytime during opening hours. We visited the temple in the evening when it was drizzling. Luckily the next morning the weather was beautiful. We reenter the temple and took some beautiful pictures. The temple is not very high and my parents who are in their 70s managed to go up to the top.

Finally last summer we flew to Bali for a stay at the beautiful ClubMed resort.(I already reviewed earlier). And from Bali it's easy to fly to jogjakarta and Borobodur and back to Bali in one day (flight less than an hour), and enjoy the beauty of Borobodur and a couple of other temples.And it's worth it....It is the largest and the oldest Buddhist temple in the world and certainly one of the most impressive. From top the view is mind blowing and you see the volcano , mount Merapi and is plume of fumes.The stairs are very steep and narrow and it's always packed with visitors, whether tourist or locals, all pushing to get a spot...The worst is the plague of the 'selfie locusts' (they too have antennas) who invade all the popular sites.Without any respect for  children or elder people. And it can be though, especially on holidays. It can be very crowded. And very hot. Better avoid holidays or high season. Though for older people and small children. I recommend -since it's still a holy place you have to cover your legs- to avoid wearing shorts (also for men) or short skirts.

If you want to visit the temple, please ensure your trousers or skirt is below the knee length. If not, they will provide you with a piece of cloth (I am not sure if there is any additional fees for this). Price wise, the entrance fees is quiet expensive for me - 260,000 IDR plus the tram fees 7,500 IDR but considering the park is so huge and both the park and the temple are well kept, it is worth the investment. For entrance fees, you can buy directly from the counter or for our case, our driver bring us to buy from travel agency with the same price. You can opt out from taking the tram but you have to walk quiet far from entrance to temple and time is gold peopleee...We went there around 9am (plus on weekend), there are already lots of tourist but we take our time strolling at every level (and taking lots of picture of course!).

And you get a free bottle of water!Anyway.. the site is beautiful.  It is one main structure but the grounds are quite large so there is ample piece and quiet.  The grounds are quite well maintained.  Lots of photo opportunities here. But LOTS of selfie poles too.  I love places that ban these things.  I wish i had arrived at 6 when it opened to have a bit of time before the school groups started showing up.  And maybe all the parks in Canada should charge Indonesians 10 times what Canadians pay to enter a park.  This place gets busy with groups.  I stayed for 5 hours and got every photo i wanted and just relaxed in the green areas.  Every terrace is worth walking around  as the whole place is quite ornate.  Carvings everywhere.

At the base the stepped pyramid shaped structure is 120 m square, and the facade is covered in bass reliefs of world class merit depicting ""creation"" (lowest level) followed by the life of Buddha.

About 80% of the statues are ""headless"", but overall the rich carvings and commanding views are amazing.  Open 6:00 am to 6 pm.

I was charged IDR 270K for a 'Domestic Adult' ticket as I have a KITAS (Indonesia work permit) but seems like locals pay a fraction of this.However, in my opinion it's worth the price as this really is one of the most beautiful temples I've visited.

"New Delhi, India",5.0,"Borobudur Buddhist Temple is located about a 2-hour drive from downtown Yogyakarta, and is a UNESCO World heritage site that is a must visit for all tourists to this city. This temple like the contemporary nearby Prambanan group of Hindu temples, was built about 1200 years ago and is a reminder of the ancient spread of Buddhism from India to  South-East Asian region. Buddhist Shailendra Dynesty  that was powerful in Jawa in 9th century, built this temple. One has to climb steep stone staircase to reach the temple but the climb can be halted as there are three levels of the temples that must all be seen. The Borobudur  temple like the Prambanan Hindu temples, was destroyed a couple of times (In the year 1006 and latest being in the year 2006) due to earth quakes (there is a live volcano nearby) and was rebuild, most recently by Dutch archeologists. Indonesia had been under the Dutch rule and still has a strong connection with Netherland. The technique for building the  temple by using  inter-locking stone blocks in a Lago like fashion without using any cement like adhesive, is also similar to the contemporary Prambanan temples, but the architectural features are very different. When the temple fell apart and stones scattered all over due to earth quake, rebuilding the temple was like solving a jig-saw puzzle of placing stones back again in the original order. The re-constructed temple is impressive. Hindus and Buddhists made up the bulk of ancient Indonesian population till 16th century when Sufi Islam came to Indonesia through Islamic preachers from the Gujarat region of India. At present  Indonesia is predominantly Muslim except for the island of Bali that is predominantly Hindu even today. Buddhists constitute less than 1% of the Indonesian population at present. The Boroduru Buddhist temple  though very impressive and a great tourist attraction, is therefore not an active temple anymore. No regular religious ceremonies and rituals are held on the site now except on the birthday of Buddha (June 3, Vesak day), that is very auspicious for Buddhists.  There is a huge handicraft and garment market strategically placed at the end of the visit so all visitors pass through it after seeing the temple.  The temple site is a good two hour drive from the center of the city and is well preserved and managed. Entrance fee to the temple for foreigners is rather steep at about Rs. 300,000 Indonesian rupiah (for natives the fee is 30,000 rupiah). One can however buy a combo entrance ticket for about US$ 35 for this   temple and the equally important and contemporary Hindu Prambanan temple   (about 2 hours drive away from Borobudur) and save about 100,000 rupiah. Both places may be covered in one day. One should keep about 2 hours for visit to this important site. Keep a water bottle and an umbrella / hat as the place can very be hot and humid.",2016-12-31,Family,2016-12,india,22.3511148,78.6677428

Just note that there are different stairs for going up and down. Borobudur temple is higher than it looks. The steps are pretty steep as well so do be careful. You'll be panting (told you it's breathtaking) once you're at the top but it's worth it.

It was very easy to take photos without other people getting in the shot. After going around the almost deserted temple, I found a spot and just sat there to enjoy the tranquility. Surprisingly, only one group of tourists arrived before I left around 8am to check out their museum. Went back before noon and still not as many people.",2016-12-13,Solo,2016-12,,,

"Warsaw, Poland",5.0,"We went on a combined trip Borobudur + Prambanan. We booked transport at our hotel for IDR 140,000. The combined ticket for both sites costed IDR 420,000 - that's a price for foreigners as Indonesians pay IDR 50,000 (sic!). Trip included the sunrise spot at Bukit Barede with a view to Borobudur temple - there we had to pay IDR 30,000 per person to enter the hill. If you want to place yourself on a platform you need to pay another fee - that we did not staying on the ground. As it's getting brighter and brighter, you realise that the temple is much further than you expect - you can see the top but to get some photos you will need a good telephoto lens on your camera. So paying for the platform is a waste of money in my opinion. But it's a perfect business - make people pay to enter someone's hill :-) The overall view was nice but I repeat - it's not what you expect so if you are deciding where to go for the sunrise, the temple itself may be a better option. After the sunrise watched from the hill, we were taken to Borobudur. Morning was a perfect time to visit as it was not too hot. Borobudur is a huge - actually the world's largest - Buddhist temple built in 9th century, abandoned in 14th and rediscovered in 19th. World Heritage site since 1991.

We had a choice of coffee, tea or water with our ticket. Our hotel had packed us breakfast which we now enjoyed before the start of the visit. Because of the marathon, there was no one around to ask us to cover ourselves up. Most of everyone here i.e. participants were in their track suits or shorts.

"Tagaytay, Philippines",4.0,"Multiple busloads of cruise ship passengers increased the usual daytime overcrowding of visitors to Borobudur Temple, the largest single monument (step pyramid) in the Southern Hemisphere, was covered by jungle until its rediscovery in 1814 by Sir Stamford Raffles. It was built by the 9th Century Mahayana Buddhist kings of the Sailendra Dynasty.Before we can enter we must wear a batik sarong to cover our waist to our knees. On some tourists it was from the hips (under the belly) to below the knees. The sarong is provided as part of the entrance fee.  Some tourists took two, one to wear now and one to show friends at home. Our official Guide explained the Stupa on top or Great Stupa represents the rice bowl of Buddha upside down as if it were sitting on a table.  The handle on the bottom of the rice bowl is to make it easier for the monks and Buddha to hold while asking for alms. A stupa is a mound-like or hemispherical structure containing relics (typically the remains of Buddhist monks or nuns), and used as a place of meditation. The other 72 Stupas are Buddha’s previous rice bowls to reach enlightenment (Nirvana).    The guide pointed to pilgrims that were guided by the system of staircases and corridors ascending to the top platform. Each platform of the step pyramid represents one stage of enlightenment. The path that guides pilgrims was designed to symbolize Buddhist cosmology. An umbrella for personal shade is strongly recommended. Two local men carrying umbrellas wanted to provide shade for those in our group that were willing to pay.  When asked how much they would only say “What you like.” The couples that did accept their offer planned on paying $20 usd each. A park official explained they are only permitted to accept $10 usd or aud each.  Borobudur has perhaps the finest examples of Buddhist reliefs in the world.  I strongly recommend bringing at least one book to help understand each relief or take lots and lots of pictures and look it up.  The guides have a few reliefs they are familiar with and explain when they are not herding their tourists. Watching the reconstruction work of the reliefs and the decks is a marvel of stone work still performed by hand.   The view from the top step is not to be missed if you can climb that high.  There are no lifts or escalators which does make it not disability friendly.    Our 9 hour cruise ship shore excursion “Borobudur by Train” cost us $259.95 usd per person which many felt was too expensive.  There were claims of companies offering similar tours for $100 usd per person with no police escort.  The screams of the tourists and the amusement of riding the police escorted bus on all sides of the road make the trip worth every cent.",2016-11-27,Couples,2015-12,philippines,12.7503486,122.7312101

"Melbourne, Australia",4.0,"Took sunrise ""tour""  which is essentially shared transportation to and from Manohara hotel, which is the only entrance before hours to the temple. I paid 110k for this with Maria at Bottle Trip tours. We arrived well in time to walk up to the top for the 5.15am sunrise, with pickup scheduled for 8.30.Ticket is very pricey for sunrise inside the temple (they charge 400k) and includes an emergency raincoat and torch, which if you return you get a souvenir. The inclusive breakfast at Manohara is just two snacks and tea/coffee. Temple itself was impressive, before hours meant it was crowded but not too bad once sunrise finished. Multi levels and large walls mean you can walk around the temple appreciating some solitude if you're lucky. Note the stairs are quite high and steep, may be some work for the elderly or injured. Borobudur Museum was small but had some detail on the history and the meaning of the levels and murals all over the temple. Many Buddha heads are missing due to thieves selling them to overseas museums. Lucky enough to see a decent sunrise with the mist in the rainy season where it's really not guaranteed, made it all worth it! Despite the higher price I enjoyed this far more than the more crowded, touristic and small Prambanan temple complex. There were clear efforts to conserve the temple from all its visitors without being too intrusive. Would recommend visiting on a weekday as I went on a Saturday, and by the time I was heading back at 6.30 there were literally hundreds of school students on a trip heading up to the temple.",2016-11-25,Solo,2016-11,australia,-24.7761086,134.755

"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",4.0,"The Borobudur is not a building with a temple in the interior, but it consists of several large terraces, that are built  in layers on the outsides of a hill.   A seemingly endless amount of relief panels is arranged on the ‘mountain side’  along the terraces, with images from the life of Buddha and clues about the 'right' path. These sculptures are really impressive to see, but the explanations of our guide, we unfortunately found somewhat  superficial. In a good paper guide we could have read it also.In the morning monks still walk clockwise around the mountain. After each round they go to a higher terrace to symbolize how to outdistance the stages of earthly life. The path they follow eventually leads to the upper 'stupa', which symbolizes Nirvana. Also as  visitors we would have liked to experience just a little bit of such atmosphere of detachment. But with so many visitors (in the peak months more than 20,000 per day) that fails; as we ascended, the terraces were getting smaller , and because everyone wants to reach the top, it became less and less 'Nirvana' and more and more 'Rush hour in the subway’.We saw afterwards that you can also pay a visit to the Borobudur at sunrise. (may be also a nice alternative to a sunrise on some volcano?). That we would do a next time, in order to better experience the unique atmosphere of this temple.

"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",5.0,"I have visited Borobudur Temple a couple of times, two times in 2015 alone. I was to take a group of family and friends. So one Indonesian can visit Borobudur Temple several times in their life, not because the entrance fee is much less than International visitors must pay, but because I should for some reasons. Even when I pay IDR 50.000 for a single day entry, it's very expensive for my standard. I may have another friend or family to take the next day so I should pay another 50. One Indonesian will probably visit Borobudur Temple several times in their life; once when they are kid, when they are student, when they have girlfriend, when they just get married, when they have kids, when they have big family and a number of occasion. There are multiple fifty they should pay.I  am not talking about money but this's really not white or black discrimination policy as I have read in the previous reviews. There are thousands of people rely their lives on the influx of tourist (as everywhere in the world)  especially the locals. So they don't just see tourist come and go in their villages. The management carries social responsibility to facilitate the people, to protect the environment and especially to preserve the heritage.The existence of souvenir market and vendors may an example to give opportunity for the locals.So, travellers must undertand regarding the different in ticket price between domestic and international visitors.

It was fantastic. The site is quite large and in the predawn light eerily spectacular. The sunrise was misty but for me that was no big deal, I just loved being there. I stayed there for many hours and really enjoyed it. The carvings and stonework are fascinating. The people watching was also fascinating.

If you have a student ID without an expiry date, bring it to lower your cost as you get a 50% discount which feels good as the combo ticket is 32$ for foreigners!

Both temples are different but you will understand when you see the temples. The location of the temple is right in the middle of a plain and is extremely hot so make sure to have enough water as you get dehydrated really fast especially since the volcanic stones the temple is made of are giving back the heat.We visited during the low season (October) and managed to get pictures without people on them.

,5.0,"Borobudur has been standing majesticly for ages on Java island. Its history related to Javanese spiritual wisdom named Kejawen. Where we will find the Hinduism and Buddhism crossing and intertwined. Similar traits to seek the enlightenment, living in harmony and oneness. It was my fourth time visiting the site. Which in between was very farly separated in times. An infant-knowing nothing but an old print photograph of chubby kid with grand temple. Then as pre teen in school excursion, sharing the space with numerous person that packed in the area. Following years as young adult whose career just started, the more colourfull photographs saved neatly tucked in timeline folder, silly poses, fun faces and laughters shared within travel mates.Latest one on spiritual journey to really seek out the questions on what it is that attracting thousands if not billions visitor annually to visit despite its grandeousness.  All those happened under the heat of the sunny day. Those who seek spiritual connection or whom are familiar with yoga truly is, can discover something more than just ticking the box foor good perfect angle of photographes and amidst photo bombers. Walk the walk barefoot, let yourself be open minded and get lectured by a local guide. We are a group of 4 travellers, 1 domestic and 3 internationals, coicidently meet up with Bapak Agus Dwi Widodo as our guide. By one short hour, we were brought deeply into philosophies, palm reading, panels (interpretations through old wisdom passed on generations of the story lies on the sets of beautiful stone carvings) reading, knowledge of Kejawen kidung and mudra that similarly to Patanjali and yet distinctive for charactherized into Javanese. He is a registered guide, whom at the end of our short guided tour we're deeply impressed and feeling blessed to just be able to listen to him.I personally recommended him for those who really seek out cultural knowledge, spiritualism of Kejawen. He is humble, communicative, has good humor and apparently breakdancing as well. 1 hour is short period of times to cover whole panels. Yet, it was perfect. As that in quantified imperfection lies the perfection. So, as the guide ends, so our 'class' end. Are we become experts in Borobudur?

"Colombo, Sri Lanka",5.0,A must see for anyone visiting Indonesia!!! Make sure you go for the Sunrise as it gives an opportunity for some awesome pictures. It starts from 5am and costs IDR 400k for foreigners but I think it's worth it. Get a guide so that they can explain the structure and its history. The place gets crowded after around 7am and also with the sun gets progressively hotter hence more the reason to catch the sun rise tour. We stayed at Megelan as it's closer so one doesn't have to wake up really early as if not from the town it can take over an hour to get there. The climb is manageable but can be a bit tough for senior citizens but my 70+ year old father in law managed with a little bit of difficulty. Wear trousers and not revealing clothes as this is a religious place.

Thankfully an invitation to speak at a conference at Yogyakarta realised my dream. Yogya as locals call this city is about an hour and quarter away from Borobodur. What strikes you as soon as you enter the complex is the vastness of the place as also the cleanliness. Having many thousand of visitors, keeping a world heritage site clean and attractive is itself a big task. The authorities there have done a great job. The guides are polite and well versed in the history of the place. Our guide took pleasure in pointing out how an overwhelmingly Muslim country has managed the Buddhist shrine well. I suppose his pride is not misplaced. A surprise for all of us was the breakfast that was on offer along with the ticket at the restaurant on campus. It was a large buffet spread and offered a range of food. The temple itself has been carefully restored and the grounds nicely kept. A few more signages would have been nice. Our guide however was very well informed. The climbing takes a toll on you as the ancient steps are pretty steep and the weather hot and humid. A must carry is water and maybe a bar of chocolate.

Its splendor and expanse is really awe inspiring.Constructed on nine levels, with Buddha's statues in various mudras and stone carvings of Jataka Tales, it depicts  Buddhist philosophy which also makes one wonder about the skill of stone carvers of that period.Best to visit in early morning hours as it involves considerable climbing.

We were lucky to have a clear morning and the views were breathtaking, it's definitely worth the extra entrance fee. It's a shame it gets a bit crowded however if you hang about for a while after sunrise the crowds do quieten down. After sunrise we got a complementary coffee and snack. My friend and I were really excited to ride the elephants around the park however they didn't start until 8:30, so we decided to walk over to see them. I was really shocked to find the elephants confined into a tiny space and their legs chained up. I'd hate to think that they'd been in the same position the whole night with restricted movement. I've never seen elephants look this sad before. This really dampened our mood after the amazing  morning we had. It's a shame as the grounds around the temple are huge so more effort could be made to help out these amazing animals! Therefore we decided not ride them and wouldn't advise others. If you don't believe me have a walk over to their ""house"" via the north exit from the temple. That's why we have given this experience 3/5! The temple itself is 5/5, I wish we'd never gone over to the elephants and it would have  been a fantastic day !!",2016-10-18,Friends,2016-10,united kingdom,54.7023545,-3.2765753

There was just another couple with me and we tended to stick together.  Once you pay the expensive Manohara sunrise entrance fee, they let you borrow a flashlight and then you climb up to the top.  The steps are pretty steep but the climb isnt too bad.  I had low expectations but we were able to see a little bit of sunrise through a small gap in the clouds.  Definitely nothing compared to the photos.  We looked around the temple for an hour or so after sunrise then left.  As you work your way down, the levels start looking the same.  They provide a cheap breakfast of fried banana and some sort of cake with coffee or tea.  They had no taste.  They picked us up at 9:30 and drove us back to our hotel.

"Milford, OH",3.0,"Borobudur is a massive Buddhist temple situated in Central Java, Indonesia, not far from Yogyakarta Province and Solo.  This multi-tiered structure is covered with carvings (bas-relief?) that depict scenes from Prince Siddharta's life as the Buddha and statues, and has been restored to an approximation of its former glory.  Some of the statues of Buddha are headless due to thefts.  The top level contains a large number of ""stupa"" and in each sits a meditating Buddha statue.  Local superstition says that if you can reach in and touch the Buddha's hand, you will be blessed. ;))Since the area surrounding the temple has largely been cleared of trees, it is fairly hot during the day time.  It is suggested you bring a wide-brimmed hat or sun umbrella, or at least use sun block to protect your skin.  You can buy hats there that are made with colorful batik cloth and bamboo slats that can double as a hand fan, along with numerous other gifts.Getting in is cheap, if you are a local, a holder of an ""ITAS"" (1-year stay permit) or a permanent resident like me.  If you are just visiting Indonesia, however, the fee is much larger - I believe it is somewhere in the area of US $15.  You can't circumvent this by having a local buy you a ticket - a tourist's ticket looks different and you go through a different door.As soon as you get in, you're liable to be met by several vendors peddling a variety of gifts and perhaps drinks and food.  The best course of action, if you're not interested in haggling, is to smile, shake your head and keep walking until they go away.If you want to purchase, you should assume that the prices have been jacked up far above normal because you look foreign, and you can safely start from a position of 1/4 of their asking price. If you really feel they're being unfair, you can always walk away after haggling - they may offer a better price.Once you are in, there isn't just the gigantic structure - there are smaller structures, and two museums next to each other, as well as a place to buy junk food snacks and drinks.Since this is an ancient structure, you're going to be walking up steep steps - there are no escalators or lifts.  There are rails and, if you get tired, it's a short trip up to the next tier where you can step to the side and walk all the way around.  The view of the surrounding area is nice and can help you locate the other attractions within the property.When you're running about, you're liable to be approached by students who are there with the assignment of interviewing foreigners in English.  They will probably be very excited and grateful if you're willing to help them - please do, if you can, because many will never get another chance in their youth to interact with a foreigner.  It will also give them some measure of confidence in using English, which they are afraid to do because they don't want to make any mistakes (it's a cultural issue).The 2 museums sport different things to look at, including a replica of a sailing ship, archaeological artifacts, and information.  You won't find any vendors inside, and it's a good way to escape the heat of the sunlight.Probably the biggest hassle is getting out.  They have set up a serpentine maze of vending stalls that takes several minutes to walk out of.  I have never been able to find a more direct route out, and I personally am not interested in buying things so it is irksome for me.  However, if you want food, clothes, art, batik, trinkets, baubles and other souvenirs, you will find a massive array of choices.If you buy beverages in Indonesia, I do caution against iced drinks unless you can verify they use filtered/bottled water and a machine.  Traditional blocks of ice using boiled water are still common, and they are sometimes transported in unhygienic ways, which means you can easily get a case of diarrhea, typhoid, amoebic dysentery, etc.  The same caution can be said of some foods - especially uncooked foods like karedok, but the biggest threat is the vendors and their poor hygiene.  Street food is usually cheap but it is also usually full of MSG, and there are vendors who use illegal - even potentially fatal - additives, such as textile dye, boric acid, formaldehyde, rotten food, spoiled milk, etc.  Choose with caution and use common sense - if it's sitting out in dishes and it didn't JUST come out of the kitchen in your view, it may have been sitting there for several hours - certainly long enough for bacteria to flourish as the idea of keeping things heated is a fairly uncommon thing here.  It's best to choose HOT food that is prepared in front of you.  If you don't see flies trying to get at the food, there's a good chance they added something to the food to keep them away and preserve it, which may be bad.  Of course, flies don't like everything!Always have some loperamide in your bag for diarrhea - it's much cheaper than buying a name brand and most pharmacies lack the scruples to require a prescription for it (and many other prescription drugs), but you will not find Polysporin in Indonesia, so if you like that as your antibiotic salve, bring it from home.  Deworming medicine is available over-the-counter.  If you are willing to go the natural route, I can personally recommend the following:For diarrhea, in order of effectiveness:strongly bitter teayoung (they are smaller, lighter in color and easier to chew) guava leaves""daun jintan"" (Plectranthus amboinicus sin. Coleus amboinicus)Stomach ache and other digestive trouble:""daun jintan"" (Plectranthus amboinicus sin. Coleus amboinicus)Both the P. amboinicus and guava leaves can suppress the symptoms of colitis, too.  It is recommended that you consume about 5-7 leaves 3x/day for no less than 3 days.  If, after that time, the illness comes back you should seek medical attention.Dizziness:Spanish saffron (not Balinese) heated up in milk and drunk.  This will not help for hypotension.Bug bites: (don't scratch them first!)A thin paste of baking soda and vinegar spread on the bites.  The bubbling action fascinates kids!Burns and sunburn:Aloe vera for 1st & 2nd degree burnsSevere burns need to be treated with antibiotic first if you don't seek medical attentionOh, BTW, the advice to make your AC cold to keep away the mosquitoes is false.  They will simply fly under the covers and bite you using your warmth for their benefit.I was there with a large group of students, but I have been there before with family - it really hasn't changed much, except for the market getting longer.  If you go early in the day, you're less likely to meet students.  Early or late is best to avoid the worst of the heat.",2016-10-14,Business,2016-05,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882

"Southampton, UK",5.0,"We visited Borobudur as part of an organised visit from our cruise ship. The traffic between the port of Samarang and Borobudur is such that a police escort is required to enable visitors to visit the site and return to the ship before it sails. Very difficult to accomplish on a trip organised by individuals. The site is a magnificent structure and a must for any visit to Java. We arrived about eleven in the morning and were provided with a sarong to wear whilst at the temple, I understand this is a fairly recent introduction but there was no charge unless it was included in our tour fee. After a few minutes stood in very hot sun listening to the group guide we decided to explore on our own at our own pace. We arranged to meet at midday to be taken to the large covered area close to the temple where a meal was to be served. The temple was extremely crowded and made worse by the large number of people waving selfie sticks and umbrellas. By the time set to go for our meal the site suddenly emptied and we were able explore the site with only a few others. Our guide was worried we would not have time for our meal but we would have happily foregone the meal to see Borobudur without the crowds. As it happened we did have time for a meal before joining one of the ten coaches escorted back to the boat. Fortunately, or unfortunately if like us you prefer not to visit local jewellery and souvenir shops, there was time to stop on the way back. I do appreciate and wholeheartedly support the fact this does ensure some of the tourist money stays in the country whereas much of our tour fee would probably go into the cruse ship coffers. If you are visiting Borobudur whilst staying in Java I would avoid late morning when the tour groups from the cruise ships will be present and if you are part of the cruise ship tour try arranging with your guide to arrive late for your meal to give time to visit away from the crowds.

While most of the photographs exaggerate its beauty and scale, the views are still pretty splendid and the photographs are worth saving and sharing for the rest of your lives. Our visit to the temple was on a misty morning after pretty heavy rains the previous evening, so the sunrise wasn't visible at all but in spite of that we were still amazed by the beauty of the temple and experienced a whole different set of colors, equally extraordinary (we called it a 'mist'ical experience)Do ensure that you have an experienced guide with you as he/she really enhances the experience of your visit.

I did it in every grade until finally we reached the top. It's more fun to do like that then just go straight to the top.

"Darwin, Australia",5.0,"Spending 2 nights in Yogyakarta was enough. Squeezing in a limited time at Yogyakarta all the places we would like to see in one day was good enough. In spite of very little English, our local driver was good and took us to places as indicated in our itinerary. We were glad we did it this way instead of joining an expensive tour package advertised in websites. We were in full control of our time and no rushing.  In spite of another hot day at Borobudur Temple, we were very pleased of the service of our local tour guide, an old man who spoke good English and had sound knowledge of history of Borobudur Temple. The enormity of Borobudur Temple being the largest and the grandest Buddhist Temple in the world is overwhelming.  Borobudur is an awesome structure and my wish to visit this place surely came true.  Personally, the time spent constructing this temple was beyond my imagination.  Imagine, 55K cubic metres of stones were taken from the neighbouring rivers, cut to various sizes and transported to these elevated areas and laid together without mortar! The structure has 9 stacked platforms, 3 circular platforms and an enormous central dome. It underwent several restorations when UNESCO and Indonesian government worked together to make it the way it is at present, hoping that it will survive for the next thousand years for people to enjoy and behold.The other magnificent temple we visited was the Prambanan Temple, the most beautiful and the largest Hindu Temple in the world. This one also suffered extensive damage due to earthquake and volcanic eruption but restoration is continuing to present. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The three huge temples in the compound have been dedicated to Brahma - the Creator, Vishnu - the Preserver and Shiva - the Destroyer. This ancient architecture with intricate design and carvings is just amazing and splendid.Other places of cultural interest we visited were the Sultan Palace and Taman Sari (Water Castle).

If plenty of time ie more than 5 hours, suggest to watch.Once approaching entrance of stupa, ask the guards where are the foto points for ads etc as these are good for taking the overall borobudur as background & less back people walking.Well maintained stones despite the 2 volcanos ash incident and over-numbered vandalism visitors. Can be improved with more active security guards or guided tours instead to prevent people from climbing the stupas or sticking their hands in to try and touch the buddha statues / ""shake hands"". Clearly the signs that says ""do not sit"" or ""do not climb"" is ineffective.Top 3 tiers are:Level 8 has 13 statue with headLevel 9 has 3 statue with headLevel 10(tip) has 1 statue with head and 1 empty stupa!After arriving the tip,ask security for the exit stairs as not same with the entrance.Lots of shops abt 30 at the exit, make sure to walk and check out a few stores before returning and bargain !

However, what I would think strongly about is whether to do the sunrise tour. We decided to do it which involves getting up at 4am maybe earlier depending where your staying. We were left quite disappointed as there was heavy fog, we couldn't see a thing. it was still pretty cool but not spectacular. We enjoyed it more once the sun was fully up and burned away the fog. My advice would be to take a quick look at the forecast the day before and base your decision on that. We visited the temple in July. We did two sunrise tours in Indonesia, another for mt Bromo and that too had heavy fog creating very low visibility so maybe it is just the time of year I'm not sure.",2016-09-07,,2016-07,,,

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"Candi Borobudur is located in Magelang, Central Java. It is about 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes drive from the Daerah Istimewa Jogjakarta/ Special Province of Jogjakarta. On the way there, you will pass by villages, plantations and silver factories all of which are under Java's crown volcanoes, Mt Merapi and Mt Merbabu in the background. The car I was in stopped at the entrance, and the driver told me he will wait at  Parkir B, also asked for his number just in case. I went to the Loket Masuk/Ticketing Office to get foreigner ticket priced at Rp 260,000 this comes with a complimentary mineral water, tea or coffee. If you are showing some legs you will be required to cover with a cloth they provide. A good short walk (5 minutes) from the Loket/Ticketing will lead you to the Borobudur Temple itself. During the walk to the temple grounds, you will face the usual sellers with souveniers, hats or umbrella. It gets burning hot, umbrellas were at Rp 5,000. The sellers can be persistent for some, but mostly they will leave you alone after you decline. They would actually just tell you that it is hot inside and you should get an umbrella. They are not wrong here cos it can get mighty hot and I saw some people getting umbrellas.The entire temple grounds itself is guarded so no sellers in here and you can enjoy the scenery. It's majestic and beautiful and you can explore the temple grounds with a guide or without a guide. Nothing can beat the human eye really so take it all in once you are there. The stones were arranged without cement and were designed with some locking mechanism. Imagine how the entire temple was built in the 9th century, breathtaking so enjoy it. I spend around 90 minutes here.Exit: I thought the exit process was well thought out supporting local industry and sellers of handicrafts. During the exit process, you would have to go through a few turns of the market/local artcrafts. Shop keepers would mostly leave you on your own, but the ""mobile"" touts would be around so expect them going to you while you walk along the way. Some souveniers caught my eye but the long line of touts up front didnt really make me want to stop. Luckily, my driver was somewhere around Parkir B. While I was going round and round (slight panic here) and texting him, he managed to find me. For some not used to touts, it can be overwhelming initially. Otherwise, politely decline, let them follow you for abit and then they will leave you alone after that.

"Geneva, Switzerland",5.0,"Borobudur, or Barabudur, is a 9th-centuryMahayana Buddhist temple in Magelang,Central Java, Indonesia. The monument consists of nine stacked platforms, six square and three circular, topped by a central dome. The temple is decorated with 2,672 reliefpanels and 504 Buddha statues. The central dome is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues, each seated inside a perforated stupa.[1] It is the world's largest Buddhist temple,[2][3] as well as one of the greatest Buddhist monuments in the world.[4]Built in the 9th century during the reign of theSailendra Dynasty, the temple was designed in Javanese Buddhist architecture, which blends the Indonesian indigenous cult ofancestor worship and the Buddhist concept of attaining Nirvana.[4] The temple also demonstrates the influences of Gupta art that reflects India's influence on the region, yet there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian.[5][6] The monument is both a shrine to the Lord Buddha and a place for Buddhist pilgrimage. The journey for pilgrims begins at the base of the monument and follows a path around the monument and ascends to the top through three levels symbolic of Buddhist cosmology: Kāmadhātu(the world of desire), Rupadhatu (the world of forms) and Arupadhatu (the world of formlessness). The monument guides pilgrims through an extensive system of stairways and corridors with 1,460 narrative relief panels on the walls and the balustrades.

"Singapore, Singapore",4.0,"Awesomely beautiful but very crowded. Booked the manohara sunrise tour -400k IDR (for foreigners) you can purchase tickets at the hotel lobby the same day. But unfortunately it was very foggy and did not get to see the so called famous Borobudur sunrise but as the day progressed and daylight hit the temple the architecture came alive, its mesmerising. Tip to chose the best spot - as you climb up 2nd top floor look for the stupa with exposed Buddha head. Sit at angle to the head to capture those sunrays falling on the statue of Buddha. Otherways of doing Borobodur temple 1. Manohara Borobodur Sunset tour - 400k IDR - less crowd as many come for sunrise. and more predictable - you will already know if it is foggy or cloudy or clear sky. 2. Buy ticket at the park - 20 USD . or buy combo prambanan + borobodur ticket at 32 USD valid for 2 days. 3. Setumbu hill- lot of agents will try to lure you to see sunrise from setumbu hills. View is good nature wise but to see Borobodur temple clearly in background you will need some real zoom lenses. Parking tips - for those who are scooting from Yogyakarta free parking is available at Manohara hotel if you are taking Manohara sunrise tour or may be you can tell them that you are no1 checks tickets. Lot of agents and shop offer parking space around the temple (esp near the entrance) for a fee. I did see a 2 wheeler parking lot inside the complex you need to drive along the park complex (direction opp to manohara). Stay - I stayed at Mettaloka arthouse - it was amazing.

Friends went to the temple and were slightly disappointed when trying to take the iconic sunrise picture we've all seen in a magazine somewhere, that there were lots of people and therefore impossible to take a picture without a person in it at sunrise. We hired a personal guide for 100,000 Rp. for up to 4 people for an hour. It was well worth it. He gave us a lot of information about the purpose of the nine levels, restoration efforts over time and lately funded by UNESCO, the story of Buddha in carvings and the story before Buddha, and took us to the best photo ops for the time of day. He took us up a level or two at a time instead of plowing right up to the top which I think is a more sensible way to approach this largest, single Buddhist temple of the world.

This time, I & my family (husband & 2 children) planned to visit Borobudur in the very early morning to see the sunrise. Off course I did some researches before went there by browsed in the website and called the PT Taman Wisata Candi Borobudur call center, the officer said that the latest time if we want to see the sunrise is at 5.30 am.I went from Purworejo (my mother in law house) at 3 am by car rental. From Purworejo to Borobudur in Magelang took 1 hour away by car. We arrived at Borobudur main gate at 4.15 am, but some residents who live near the gate said that the gate open at 6 am. I felt so strange because the information was not the same as the call center said before, so I called the call center again and evidently the gate for the sunrise tour is different from the main gate, we have to go to Manohara gate which located in Manohara hotel. The Manonahara gate is about 1-2 km away from main gate and i;'s still in Borobudur area.If you are in the main gate before 6 am, please be careful because some residents will offer you for sunrise tour in different location (Punthuk Setumbu) which it's known as the location of the Indonesian film (AADC2), they will charge about 200,000 rupiah to guide to that location. But lucky me, I call the called center again :)At last we arrived at Manohara gate at 4.30 am. In that gate there's a ticket locket to the sunrise tour. For local tourist they charge 270,000 rupiah for adult, 135,000 rupiah for children (6-10 yo) and free of charge for children under 5 yo. For foreigner, 400,000 rupiah for adult and 200,000 rupiah for children. And there's also a cost for stay-in guest who stay in Manohara Hotel, 250,000 rupiah for adult and 125,000 rupiah for children. If we compare with the cost in the main gate, which is cost only 30,000 rupiah for adult and 15,000 for children, off course this cost is much more expensive, but I promise you that you won't be regret to see the beautiful scenery of sunrise at Borobudur. After we pay and got the tickets, the officer also gave us a flashlight because to reach the top of the Borobudur temple we have to walk for about 1 km from the locket and at 5 am it's still dark. But don't worry, there're a clear directions to reach to the top of Borobudur. We reach the top of the temple at 5.15 am and we have to wait until 5.30-5.45 am to saw the sunrise.

Payment is settled on the way back, which is essential as the Dawn Princess did not, e.g., land at Ujung Pandang/Makassar as part of its Indonesia cruise due to a storm and money prepaid on an excursion will probably not be refunded unless you book with Princess.

Besides that there are some hidden pannel which is covered by the stone block to support the lower foundation of the temple. As on the mid layer there are hundreads over hollow stupa with different style of buddha hands position inside. At the top there is 1 main stupa with no relief and hole. Besides that, the temple also has a good drainage system.This is just amazing creation and how genius God creation created things even from long time ago.",2016-08-14,Family,2016-08,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992

"Brussels, Belgium",5.0,"This temple hardly needs any introduction, so here are a few tips. Be sure to take a guide (the official ones inside cost 100,000 Rp - about €6), there is a desk just after you buy your ticket. Ours, Jamal, was great and spoke very good English. He explained the architecture and some of the reliefs. Don't miss the beetle sitting on the head of the Buddha in one of the open stupors at the Nirwana level. Jamal told us it sits to protect him and has been known to attack large birds coming close. He threw up a bit of cardboard and every time the huge beetle would fly towards it and then back to Buddha. He says it's always there. Curious! After the temple we went on a village tour with Jaker. These are local guides helping their community and it was very interesting too - we saw tofu, pottery and batik being made then visited a Luwak coffee place. I would highly recommend them - just google Jaker tours. They belong to the Lotus 2 guesthouse in Borobodur.",2016-08-13,Family,2016-08,belgium,50.6402809,4.6667145

The tours you book do not include entrance fee FYI.).Highly recommend hiring a guide once you get inside. We paid 100,000 and split this between a few of us. This way, we were able to learn about the stories on the panels on the lower-level terraces. An added benefit is these are less crowded, and you can take good pictures there. Very interesting.

Our driver told us that Sunday is a very busy day. 2.- Temple fees, it is very expensive during the day (8-5pm) is 260,000.00 rupeas each person and for Sunrise and Sunset is 400,000.00 rupeas each for each person, so you should get ready for does high fees, and you can't come back even the same day, so it is a little pricey. 3.- the best most likely will be to stay in one of the local hotels. 4.- The town in itself is rough, and not much to do beside the temple. 5.- If you are vegetarian, very difficult to find food, luckely our hotel modify their menu for us.",2016-08-06,Couples,2016-08,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882

Entrance fee for seeing that is 400 irp per person that is €35 each. Then you climb the temple with an awful lot of other tourists and wait for sun rise. Many people are talking and busy with their cameras and flashlights which takes away the potential magic of it all. We wouldn't recommend it to our friends.

"Gold Coast, Australia",5.0,"We made a special trip just to go to see Borobudur from Australia. Although Bali may have more tourists Borobudur is the single most visited site in Indonesia. Borobudur is on UNESCO World Heritage List for a very good reason. There are  not too many places like it on this planet. Siem Reap may come close but the latter has been in ruins and is being restored at present. Bagan in Myanmar has thousands of temples but they are scattered all over the city and individual temples in Bagan come nowhere near Borobudur as a single temple complex. Borobodur is about 40 km from Jogja (the local term for Yogyakarta or Jogjakarta). Borobodur is a 9th Century Buddhist Temple although it has very strong Hindu/Indian influence. It was abandoned in the 14th-century when Java converted to Islam and the Hindu & Buddhist influence declined substantially. Having been designed by a local Indonesian Buddhist it has Indonesian cultural aspects as well. It underwent restoration about 40 years ago. In certain sections it is clear which parts were restored as the newly restored parts often turn yellow. Clearly the material used in the original construction was of much higher quality than the modern restored versions.  It is a vast complex and you have to walk long distances and have to climb many many steep steps. You may choose to start very early in the morning, say 3:30 am to get to the Borobudur area and then climb a slippery and wet track to get to a mountain to get a vantage point to see sunrise over the Borobudur hills. Apparently you can also get to see the sunrise from a private hotel close to Borobudur to see the sunrise but you have to pay extra for the privilege but then may be you don't have to climb so much. Back in the valley you can buy a ticket just for Borobudur or a combination ticket which includes entrance to Borobudur and Prambanan (and hence cheaper) which is on the other side of Jogja. There is a lot of walking and climbing to do to see this impressive temple, still in use by Buddhists for certain ceremonies. The temple has nine stacked platforms, six square and three circular, topped by a central dome. There are over 2,500 relief panels and over 500 Buddha statues. To reach to the top platform you must climb many steps and it can be quite tiring and tough. Make sure you have an umbrella and plenty of water with you. You can choose your pick whether you go straight up but you will miss a lot doing that. It would be best to get to the each platform and go either in a clockwise or counter-clockwise fashion to see not only the stupas but the numerous bas-relief sculptures. The bas-reliefs depict scenes of daily life in ancient Java, from the courtly palace life, hermit in the forest, to those of commoners in the village. It also depicts temple, marketplace, various flora and fauna. The reliefs also take into account to Indian aesthetic discipline, such as pose and gesture that contain certain meanings and aesthetic value. The central dome is surrounded by over 70 Buddha statues, each seated inside a fenestrated stupas some with figure of a seated Buddha in the centre of these stupas. Unfortunately some of the figures of Buddha have lost the heads but there are enough whole ones that can be seen. There is a ""guard"" of sorts who tries hard to stop people from climbing into the open or closed stupas with variable success.",2016-08-05,Couples,2016-07,australia,-24.7761086,134.755

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",5.0,"Some say its best to visit the Borobudur before sunrise or close to sunset. Else it could be unbearably hot as there are no shades available once you reach the temple. I arrived at 3pm and its not that bad actually. As you arrive, you will highly likely be harrassed by street vendors selling hats, tshirts etc. And the opening price will very steep. Imagine this: a hat that opened at 165000 rupiah could come down to only 50000 rupiah. So bargain and bargain well.The entrance fee for indonesians and foreigners are very2 different but to me its worth the price. Before reaching the entrance you will highly likely be harrassed by a different group trying to sell drinks saying there arent any beyond the entrance. This is not true because at the entrance for foreigners, they offer you free drinks after you bought the tickets. After the entrance there is about 500m of walk before you reach the base of the temple. U can opt to either walk there or pay a small fee to get on a train. The walk up to the temple is about 150 steps. And along the way, would be good if you have a guide who can explain everything about the temple. Ours was a man named Agus. He did a good job indeed.I was told there is a foot reflexology service at the base of the temple but I didnt personally try it. On your way down and out from the temple, you will again highly likely be harrased by street vendors. Just ignore them if you dont intent to buy any surveniors. But if you are interested in their batik-motived clutch, note that it is possible to get 10 for only 100000 rupiah.

We got there in the dark and they gave us torches to use as we walked through the hotel grounds and towards the temple. The walk up the temple is a medium gradient but I do believe anyone can do it even if you walk slowly. Unfortunately there is no restriction on numbers for the sunrise option so I found it quite busy as everyone crowds to the east facing part of the temple and then its just a waiting game as you cannot explore in the dark [and you don't want to loose your place]. We had a good clear morning sunrise and it was amazing with the mist over the valley. Do take a good camera with you can an iPhone doesn't do it justice in the dawn light as the pics become grainy.

I am told that approx 7000 people visit this monument everyday and as we were leaving there around 8am, it was already getting quite busy.

Outside temple there is nice local market where one can buy soveniur and different clothes at very cheaper price. but you should bargain very well and normally the local sellers reduces the price by 70-80%!!!In Borobudur there is Museum and Ramayana ballete also, but it is only advisable if you have plan for more than 3 days to visit Jug Jakarta.10 minuts drive from the temple (towards Jug jakarta ) there is another small temple MANDUK.In jug Jakarta city, one can visit another Budhha temple called PRAMBANAN temple,Here there are different temples of Lord Shiva, Vishnu,Garuda.This temple also would take atleast 2 hours.Temple timing is 9 AM to 6 PM and ticket is 20 USD for Adults and 10 USD for Students provide you have I-Card.Another place to visit in Jug Jakarta is KRATON, The Sultan (King) Palace.It is the middle of the city.

Borobudur still jolt a sense of pride in me, as an Indonesia, and Javanese in particular. The temple is in fairly good shape and the restoration ad maintenance was in progress as we visited last weekend. Our tour guide, Bp. O'on, was a very passionate one about the spiritualism side about the temple, while giving us the history side of it, too. The local tourists crowd was a bit annoying. They have no regards to the signs urging them NOT to climb or sit on the stupas, or any other restriction for that matter. Good thing it was too hot for them to light up cigarettes, else i am pretty sure some of them will, despite the NO smoking sign. The most noticeable and ""annoying"" thing is for my boyfriend to pay 8 times more than what i paid for both Borobudur and Prambanan entry tickets. 8 TIMES!! I paid 50 thousand rupiahs, while he was ""charged"" (as in guilty to be white and foreign and wanting to visit one of the oldest Buddhist temple in Indonesia) There goes my sense of pride, it replaced by a guilty feeling for the collective ignorance of most local to think that tourist/s should be ""punished"" coz they're dared to come and visit.

It's always a little strange visiting religious sites when the guides are a different religion, so having a Muslim guide during Ramadan give us a tour of one of the largest Buddhist sites in the world, was a little lackluster. It's also missing the lovely spiritual energy of many Buddhist pilgrimage locations due to this very reason - it's not an active temple.

"Madrid, Spain",5.0,"First of all, Borobudur is a magnificent place and visiting is always worth it. However, there are some tips on how to get the most out of it. You're visit depends It is well known that Sunrise Tours are offered through the adjacent Manohara hotel; yet many people wonder wether to pay for it or not. General admission is 20$, the sunrise tour is 30$. It is completely worth it to pay that extra 10$. Regardless of how pretty Borobudur looks at sunrise, the sunrise tour allows you to enter to Borobudur from 4:30am; that's the most important thing: you beat the crowds. Regular entrance  is at 6:00am and by 6:15 the place is already ridiculously crowded.Yet, what time of the year you visit is also important when it comes to wether you get to see the sunset or not. I'll explain. I am an student so I get 50% discount on general admission. Plus I got yet another discount because I bought the Prambanan and Borobudur combined ticket at Prambanan. I ended up paying about 8$ for entering Borobudur. Then, 8$ vs 30$ is a more difficult and less obvious decision than 20$ vs 30$. This is where the time of the year becomes more important.If you are at the Borobudur entrance at 5:45am ticket in hand (As I said, I bought the combined ticket in Prambanan to avoid stopping by the ticket office again in Borobudur) and you rush your way to the top of Borobudur (You can check out the rest of the compound later); you'll make it to the top just past 6. If you're somewhere between November and February, sun will rise at about 5:25; and the temple will be fully lit by 6. If you're in July as I was, sun will rise at about 5:50; that's about the latest sunrise of the year in Borobudur and you'll still be able to take some great sunrise photos around 6:10 am. Again, hurrying to the top of Borobudur is crucial.Hope it helps!

There's a 5-star hotel near the site (admission to site included in hotel cost) if you feel you'll want to do a sunrise/sunset visit. Bring water, a hat, comfortable shoes & plenty of sunblock.

"Kingston upon Thames, UK",5.0,"Well worth the schlep to get to Borobodur and the 4am wake up call. Even the kids loved it and they were not all keen when the alarm went off!The temple is in a stunning situation overlooking the hills and volcano - beats Angkor Wat and the Taj Mahal in this regard in my view. It does get busy at sunrise but less so than other sites such as Angkor Wat and it's possible to capture shots working around the crowds.The symmetry of the architecture is stunning and each side offers a different perspective, be it the volcano, hills, jungle or the gardens below. It's so photogenic that it's almost impossible not to come away with a ton of beautiful photographs. My ten year old daughter was very inspired and spent two hours drawing. It's beautifully restored and preserved and extremely well organised. There is a security check at the entrance but it's efficient. The gardens are beautifully kept. The kids were very impressed by being handed their own torch to guide them up the stairs in the dark. When you descend there are free refreshments - tea and coffee and banana fritters and coconut cakes which were delicious - and a scarf as you leave. There are around 140 steps and some of them are steep so be prepared.Overall, a stunning site that is well worth the effort to visit. Truly memorable.

Croatia,5.0,"We were on our honeymoon and Yogyakarta was our last destination before heading back to the States. We knew we had to get a private driver but didn't want to go through a big tour agency because of their pricing and group tour factor. Thankfully we saw a post here on tripadvisor about a private driver. His name is Eko and he's from Borobudur which means he really knows the area. Originally we wanted to do the sunrise inside the temple which means you'd be paying 400,000 rupiahs (about $30) per person but the weather wasn't great so Eko suggested another place where we can watch the sunrise outside of the temple for 30,000 rupiahs ($2.50) per person. Honestly, it was a great decision due to the fact that we pretty much had the same view as we would have gotten inside the temple. Eko is friendly and kind and is always willing to accommodate to your needs! If you need a private driver for the day, definitely give him a call or an email.EkoPhone: +62 858 78305760Email: putri.gibran12@gmail.comI guarantee he will take care of you and he will not overcharge you at all.",2016-07-17,Couples,2016-07,croatia,45.3658443,15.6575209

"Singapore, Singapore",4.0,"Borobudur is a temple built in 9th Century by the then King. It is a buddhist temple. The highlight is that, it is built by carving the stones and setting them without and cement or any other type of adhesive bond. It took us about one hour and 15 mins from our Hotel at Yogyakarta (close to Yogyakarta Airport) to reach there.From parking it is about 10 mins walk to reach the ticketing counter. The ticket price is quite expensive. But there is a reduced price if someone buy Borobudur and Prambanan ticket together. We paid like 42 Sing Dollar per person for Borobudur and Prambanan ticket. If you buy combined ticket, you have two days to complete the visit in these two main attractions in Yogyakarta. With the ticket, they provide you a free drink.From ticketing counter, it is almost 20 mins walk till the temple. In between, there is a video introduction of the temple which is quite informative and it comes free with ticket. There are plenty of guides available to describe the temple during your visit, they charge around 20 Sing Dollar for the whole visit. I didn't take any of them, and i don't think its necessary as there are plenty of information available and they also provide booklets for free.The temple is not in Yogyakarta, it is in Central Java but the nearest airport is at Yogyakarta and thats why it is considered an attraction of Yogyakarta.The temple itself is beyond description. It is a true wonder and completely worth visiting even they charge high for tickets. II think there are 9 steps in the temple and if you walk around all the steps, it will make up 5 km, which will take around 3 hours to complete. The top is stunning as usual. Lots of photo taking opportunity at second and third top steps. There are two types of stupas where buddhas are kept. Diamond shape perforation and rectangular perforation. It is a local belief that if you can touch the buddha with your finger inside the stupa and wish something it comes true. I tried, and could touch two buddhas in the stupa.It took us two hours to complete going round the temple as we skipped some of the steps. Please bear in mind that, from the temple you need about 45 mins to get back to the car park. The exit has been planned through a long route between shops to increase revenue i guess. But it is irritatingly long. You keep walking and keep seeing shops with full of unnecessary stuffs. There is a drink and ice-cream shop just after you have got out of the temple before you start the puzzled road to car park. Worth taking a drink after hard work climbing the temple steps.I think it's not friendly for elderly and very young children. The steps are not that high, i would say easy to climb. Coming down time it may cause height fobia as you look down directly. Keep at least 1-2 litre water with you as the sun is very hot and one may feel thirsty while climbing.",2016-07-16,Couples,2016-07,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992

"Hollister, MO",5.0,"My love for Travelling is endless. In the beginning, it didn't matter where I go. As I got older, I got more picky. I found a list of 72 Wonders of the modern world and I use it as a guide. Borobudur, a Buddhist complex, built in the 9th century, is one of the few places left  for me to see. It is in Central Java and not a very safe place for a solo woman to wander by herself. So when my waiter from my last cruise, invited me to visit his family, I jumped at the chance. I took a plane from Singapore to Yogyakarta. It's not very expensive on a Budget airline. My Friend met me at the other end. I stayed with his family for 5 nights. We left the house at 6am the next morning for Borobudur.  At the ticket booth, I  found out there were 2 kinds of tickets - local and foreigner. My ticket included the train ride and the movie at the theatre (re: Borobudur). We chose to walk first then take the train after we came down. The train went round the complex and we could get off at any time but couldn't get back on so we took it from beginning till the end. There are several flights of stairs to climb but with my back problem, I still managed to do it slowly. It gets harder towards the TOP which has 3 levels of stupas. Each stupa enclosed a Sitting  Buddha statue, some of which are missing. Since it became a UNESCO site, renovations have been going on slowly. At the very TOP, there is a  huge stupa. That represents Nirvana. The view from the TOP is beautiful. One can see the whole complex below and the mountains beyond. The Manohara Hotel is next to the temple. It is a place for the study of Buddhism and operates as a hotel as well. It is the best place to stay if one is interested in watching the sunrise and sunsets. It is also the only place that sells tickets for entry during off hours. If I return again to take my sunrise and sunset pictures, that is where I will stay. As for the locals  pushing their wares, we must understand that if they can sell, they get to eat. Of course it is annoying, but if we understand their situation,  we will  be more tolerant and  not get so angry with them. After all, Indonesia is a 3rd world country and the people are very poor. Just think US$1 got me R$10,000.  Why not just shake your head and move on?

But with the guide, it become one of the best landmark we ever visit so far. not only because I am a Buddhist, but the place itself is very well-maintained. Here you dont only come to visit one of UNESCO's World Heritage, but you come to visit the breathtaking scenery, to learn Dhamma from the reliefs, and listening to the story about people of Java ages ago and how they manage to build such a majestic place.

,5.0,"Magnificent structure that was lost for a long time, but was eventually restored and became UNESCO listed. The foreigner entrance price may partly cover some of the costs.  Foreigners use a separate entrance located about 50 meters to the left of the local entrance. It is air conditioned and has a nice toilet.  We paid about US $30 each for entrance to this temple and Prambanan as well. They gave me a wrap around cloth to wear which turned out to be a trip hazard on the temple steps, so I removed it. It is a long walk from the entrance to the temple, close to half a kilometer.  We took the small train which we thought would save some walking but it ended up back where it started from. The place was crowded on that day and the crowd squeezed up when climbing the steps on the temple. There are dedicated up and down routes but not everybody follows the signs. A challenging climb up the stone steps which were built to the ancient building codes. Plenty of ladies with high heels managed OK. Well worth the climb to the top.  There are plenty of places to stop and rest at each of the several levels. It was a typical hot day when we visited and most people took drinking water with them. For some reason as a 60 plus foreigner, a lot of people wanted to take photos with me including parents wanting photos with their young kids and young ladies with their boyfriends.  Also a group of students approached us when we were resting in the shade and wanted to have a conversation and filmed the whole thing. So as it turned out the locals were very friendly and were not trying to rip us off as can happen sometimes. We had a vehicle with driver. It took about an hour to get there.  The driver stopped at some other places on the way back and we ended up buying things we could have managed without. But all part of the fun.

I went for sunrise and was surrounded by tourists and lots of photo taking, so it's not as sparse as some of the other reviews make it seem. The best time was just after sunrise when most sunrise tourists started to make their way back down, but the daytime ones hadn't shown up yet. During that time it was peaceful, the lighting was perfect for photos, and there was a beautiful cool mist drifting by. I took my time walking back down through all the levels. At a level near the bottom, a student who was practicing as a guide gave me a complementary tour of that level. Although she didn't know everything, I still learned much more than without her. If you don't get a guide, I recommend pulling up wikipedia on your phone while you're there as it has a lot of information on Borobudur.Oh, one last tip: if you go for sunrise, make sure you follow the map they give you to get out, not the exit signs, unless you want to run the vendor gamlet.",2016-06-24,Solo,2016-06,,,

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"The Borobudur Temple complex is one of the greatest monuments in the world. Besides being the highest symbol of Buddhism, Borobudur is also a replica of the universe. It symbolises the micro-cosmos, which is divided into three levels, in which man's world of desire is influenced by negative impulses; the middle level, the world in which man has control of his negative impulses and uses his positive impulses; the highest level, in which the world of man is no longer bounded by physical and worldly ancient desire.I originally planned to see the sunset but it was raining heavy the afternoon I arrived at Borobudur.  Woke up early the next morning to climb up the majestic structure to see the sunrise.  I was lucky enough to see the changing colours of the breaking of dawn.  Try to view this place in the early morning or towards sunset.  Not advisable to climb up the steps at noon as the stones get pretty hot.  Now that I think about it, I should have visited the temple during the rain.  I have not seen photos of Borobudur on a rainy day -- would have been great...If you are planning to visit Prambanan as well, buy the combined ticket--its cheaper.

This year was the first time and I was so lucky to be there, I only knew about it a day before but flew to Yogyakarta from Bali on the day of the event and returned the next day. The cost of entry to the enclosure and getting a lantern to light and send it up into the sky was only £5, 100,000 IDR, this was all arranged with some local friends.

We stayed at the Manohara, which I would highly recommend doing, simply because you can come and go to the temple as you please. We stayed 2 nights and visited the temple for sunrise both days. As we stayed at the Manohara, 2 days was enough time for us. I would highly recommend the sunrise viewing. Apart from the experience of being at a 9th century structure and watching the sunrise from behind Mt Merapi with the mist covered lush green jungle and gardens in the foreground, as this costs extra it is much quieter and it is worthwhile just to escape the heat or the day and the thousands of other tourists that will descend on the temple from about 7am.  Take the time to walk the grounds around the temple. They are immaculately maintained and are beautiful.  If you are from the west, expect to be the centre of attention, as local tourists will approach you wanting to know where you are from and wanting to have their photos, and their families photo's taken with you.  Whilst I could see some people being annoyed at this, my suggestion is to roll with it and have fun with it.  You may also encounter school groups that will want to try out their English speaking skills on you.We also did an Andong tour of the village and the local cottage industries which was interesting.  We also had the Andong take us to the Stupa Restaurant for lunch one day. The ride there through the rice paddies and local streets was so relaxing and the food at Stupa was great as well.

At the very top there are three platforms of giant bell-shaped stupas housing a buddha inside each one. This is where tourists flock to see the sunrise.  I did this both mornings i was there at the nearby Hotel Manohara-and while it's definitely something to do if you're touring the area I have to say that I think the sunrise is overrated.  It's crowded at the temple and if you're anxious to take photographs it's best to wait an hour after sunrise anyway when the temple is bathed in more natural light so you can really capture the detail  of the carvings.If you are a history buff or a Buddhism buff, allow yourself several hours to wander the levels of the temple. It's huge. I visited two mornings for several hours each and still did not 'see' the entire thing top to bottom. Most people come to walk to the top and then wander back down in a few hours. It's definitely worth seeing, a beautiful mystical place.",2016-06-14,Solo,2016-06,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882
"Hoorn, The Netherlands",5.0,I was expected something mind blowing like Angor. So to be honest I was a bit disappointed. Borobudur is not as great as Angor and within two hours you have seen everything. But don't get me wrong: Borobudur is still a very nice attraction. It was one of the highlights during my vacation on Java. It's a must see when you are in Indonesia. We decided to combine Borobudur and Prambanan. We bought a ticket for transportation to both locations from Kresna Tourist Service (IDR 100.000 per person). We left from Jogjakarta at 5 am and arrived at Borobudur at 6 am. This is a very good time to be there because it is not too hot yet. And also not a lot of tourists. Note: When we left at 8.30 am there came a few large groups so making nice pictures wasn't possible anymore. When you combine Borobudur and  Prambanan you get an discount on the ticket fee. Total with discount is IDR 425.000 per person.,2016-06-14,Couples,2016-06,netherlands,52.2434979,5.6343227

If you don't  like to wake up 3am in the morning just to be there around 4am then this is not for you. However; if you go after sunrise you will have to deal with more tourist and school kids who want to take pictures with you because you are American.  It is an honor but it can be overwhelming when you have a crowd of school kids approching you every minute. Overall it  a great experience but dont expected to be similar to Angkor Wat.

Borobudur is 1 temple with formal ticket kiosks, well manicured grounds, an on-site museum, and a children's jungle gym. I hate to say I was disappointed but it was very different than expected. The temple is beautiful and the view is stellar; it just feels more like an amusement park with tourist ""activities"" rather that the holy site I was anticipating. I was absolutely perturbed to discover that the only way to exit the site is to walk through a market stall complex. Booth after booth selling the exact same tacky souvenirs. I am a fast walker and it took me 15 minutes to walk through this maze of stalls. Upon exit , I was greeted with a courtyard of restaurants and stalls.

"Kingston, Jamaica",5.0,"I did the Borobudur sunrise tour on a Monday morning.  What an absolutely wonderful experience.  This actually turned out to be my favourite part of my 4 days in Jogja.  I left my hotel at 3:40 am (I had a driver) and got to Borobudur at around 4:30 am.  I paid the exorbitant foreign visitor fee of 400,000 rupiah, was given a sticker (still no idea why), a flashlight and a map and sent off to climb on up to the temple.  Make no mistake, you will have some steep steps to climb.  It's not difficult but if you are older or have knee problems, it may be a little bit of a challenge.  Still, don't let that deter you because it's TOTALLY worth the little discomfort and huffing and puffing you'll do for a couple of minutes.  By the time I sat in the perfect spot (on the 8th stupa facing east), it was around 4:45 am.  I sat there for almost an hour and it was the best 1 hour of the 4 months since I've been in Indonesia.  I watched the sun comng up behind a smoking Mr. Merapi in the distance, which was an added bonus that I didn't expect.  I watched as it slowly burned the mist off the valley below.  I watched as it slowly illuminated the impressive structure I had just climbed in the dark.  After the sun was up, I explored a few levels of the temple before heading back down.  I wandered to the museum, which wasn't that interesting, and I was harassed by men trying to sell me postcards and other things the entire way (the only annoyance in the whole experience).  Eventually, I made it back to the starting point, where light refreshment and coffee was waiting, with a gentleman playing traditional Javanese music in the background, and where I got a commemorative batik (don't get too excited, it's small and cheap-looking but a nice thought).  Overall, this is a brilliant stop on a tour of Jogja.  I'm glad I went on Monday morning - although there were still a lot of people there, it wasn't TOO crowded.  Plus, although I think it's highly priced, at least they try to add a couple of things (coffee/tea/juice, refreshments, and batik) to give the impression that you're getting something for all that money you pay.

"Perth, Australia",5.0,"We stayed around Borobudur for 3 nights for the sole intention of seeing the temple & attending the festival. We arrived at 5.45am at the main gate & were at the front of the queue. The temple is best seen early in the morning mainly because the crowds arrive at around 8am & spoils the view & atmosphere & all you see are lots of school kids wanting a selfie with you or otherwise. It is quite a large monument in extensive grounds with lots of steps so wear trainers. Even though you have all seen the typical pictures of Borobudur, it is still an amazing place to visit. Be prepared that it is equally popular with the Indonesians as with foreign tourists which probably explains the maze of shops for souvenirs that you have to navigate through in order to exit the grounds. Waisak is a huge Buddist festival & the lantern event is particularly spectacular given the surroundings & sought after. Even though the event is widely publicized, we tried to get tickets the day before but really struggled as no one seems to know anything which included the ticketing staff at temple & Manohara hotel staff where you can see the flyers at the lobby?

We decided to visit Munduk Temple from Borobudur on the morning of the festival & managed to get tickets there. 100.000Rp per person & this incl lanterns which were given out on the night. It is recommended that you wear white long sleeved top & bottom but not strictly enforced. Lighting & releasing the huge paper lanterns was the highlight of our travels to date. I can't overstate what a wonderful experience it was. However, event management can certainly make several improvements, from proper instructions to lighting these massive lanterns rather than bad demos on stage & in Indonesian only, to better signage, to be given prior warning that use of tripods is NOT PERMITTED in grounds, better ticketing sales & admittance for the event. It was persistence & luck that enabled us to see the lanterns, it shouldn't be that hard. The event was not a sell out for obvious reasons.Despite all this, Borobudur during Waisak is utterly memorable & well worth the effort of getting there",2016-05-22,Couples,2016-05,australia,-24.7761086,134.755

The scenery from the top is pretty nice if not for gloomy weathers, you could catch the sun rise or sunset here at an elevated price(27USD local, 43USD foreigner); so most people go to PUNTHUK SETUMBU instead(hill opposite borobudur- 3USD entrance fee). Other than that unless youre someone who's very interested in religious history, all the monuments are pretty much the same.

I booked my tour with the Plataran- the hotel I stayed at.There were not too many people when I did the sunrise tour so you can get great pictures without tourists. The weather is also was not as hot which was also nice. The only downfall on the sunrise tour was the fog. It took a few hours to clear to get good shots. The rush of tourists came in around 9. There were many school field trips and the kids wanted to take pictures with us and practice their English. I think it may be a school project. I saw them following quite a few English speakers.

We stayed very near to Borobudur gate, so it very convenience to go there at dawn.From our villa, we took car to Manohara Hotel. This hotel located inside Borobudur area and it's the official gate to witness sunrise experience (Borobudur itself open for public at 6am).We arrived at Manohara lobby on 4.30am. Still very dark outside, manohara staff gave us lightstick (one for each guests). Along the way, manohara staff supervise the guest so it's nearly impossible for you to stray.Up to the top of Borobudur temple, many guests are ready with their gears. We sat and wait for about 15-20 minutes before sunrise.It was the most beautiful sunrise we've ever experienced! To see the sun slowly comes up in between the twin mountains (merapi & merbabu), giving the most gorgeous sillhouette stupas. Witnessing sunrise may not always succeeded. It's nature, so you may not get a clear sky and beautiful sunrise. But for me, that's the beauty of nature. It'll surpise you, and I was surprise that morning.After you finish to look around & taking pictures, the guide from manohara will guide you back to the hotel so you could enjoy your Indonesian snack & tea/coffee. Tips: sit on the yard, you can enjoy your hot beverage with borobudur view in distance.When we return the lightstick, we got batik shawl with borobudur image on it. Yey!If you want to experiencing sunrise and enjoy the best time in Borobudur, I strongly recommend you to take this tour.

The lazy mist just refused to leave the trees in the lower ground and it was grey and white and felt so magical to me.The sunrise ticket is more expensive though. I forgot how much is it the normal entrance ticket, but for the sunrise, which you have to get from a hotel next to the temple, Plataran, is 270,000 for Indonesian and 400,000 for foreigners and you get to borrow a torch, coffee or tea and two snacks (banana and one more local sweet cake) and a gift which is a little batik scarf.My final point is, please wear something decent because it is a temple and people of different beliefs go there to pay respect.",2016-05-17,Solo,2016-05,indonesia,-2.4833826,117.8902853

Luckily we have the guide with us to explain the history of the temple. It was a bit crowded at the staircase area. And the staircase was a bit steep I must say. The guide did an excellent job of explaining to us the meaning of the carvings and statue found on the walls of the temple. We climbed all the way to the top (where permissible) and had an excellent view of the surrounding forest and village.

"Toronto, Canada",5.0,"It takes more than a day to experience what Borobudur has to offer. In the gentle light of the morning you can appreciate the fantastic location of the temple: Set in a big, lush tropical park, surrounded by a mountain range on one side and at least three volcanoes on the others. Later, when the sun casts the first shadows the reliefs show their depth and the Buddhas in the alcoves shine in soft light. As the day progresses the surrounding volcanoes disappear in the haze (unless you happen to catch an unusually clear day).To fully appreciate the roughly 3 kilometers of exquisite reliefs found in Borobudur it takes hours and a guide (and some breaks). Because it is impossible to see all reliefs in good light it is worthwhile to revisit some of them the next day in the morning to enjoy them under better circumstances.So if you are into temples then take your time. You might want to stay at Manohara which is inside Borobudur park and includes access to Borobudur temple on the day of check-in and on the day of check-out without additional charge.The only annoyance in Borobudur are the mostly young visitors who's interest in the temple is outweighed by their interest in taking selfies - alone and of course with each of their friends ;-(",2016-05-08,Solo,2016-04,canada,61.0666922,-107.991707

It rained very heavily while we were there, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The shine of the water on the temple was beautiful, and it meant there were much fewer tourists! It also meant that we were not being stopped constantly for English practice and photos, which made our visit to Prambanan slightly less enjoyable.At the exit there's an endless line of stalls to walk past...

"Maseru, Lesotho",5.0,"Borobudur is a 1200 year old temple, the most visited tourist attraction in Indonesia.  It is quite spectacular given its age with tiers of ornate sculptures and Buddhist iconography.  Entry price is high, particularly for the sunrise tour.  400k IDR for someone without local ID to enter for sunrise.Travel time to Borobudur from Yogyakarta is pretty quick, around 30-40 minutes when travelling before dawn due to the absence of traffic.  Longer later in the day presumably.Entrance for sunrise is handled by the Manohara hotel who seem to have a monopoly before sunlight.  Price of admission includes the loaning of a torch but in reality it is not so dark that the torch is needed as there is lighting along the way and at the site itself.It takes around 5 minutes to walk from the hotel to the temple.  Pre-dawn it is quite cool so it is a pleasant stroll in darker surrounds.The climb up the temple itself to the top level includes some pretty high steps.  This is not an accessible site but it is relatively easy for those who are able.The stupas and buddha sculptures are impressive given the sheer age of the place.  It does not necessarily compare to somewhere like Angkor Wat or the temples of Thailand but its longevity is a key part of its appeal.  This is a location that survived undisturbed for centuries after its heyday.  There is something special about being in the space of such an ancient form of belief.Borobudur has been restored since its original construction.  These restorations did not include the very top of the temple which is stored in a museum.  There are though quite a few signs of the restoration, particularly what looks like cement holding pieces together.Borobudur is a popular place.  A mid-week pre-dawn trip took in perhaps 30 or so other visitors.  Watching the sun rise over Borobudur is nice.  It is an experience to see the sun rise over the mountains.  The impact on the Borbudur site itself is not hugely dramatic - these are not the most ornate carvings so the effect is almost as strong in the dark as it is the light, especially with a modern camera.The structure of the temple means looking back towards the entrance is an easterly direction so attracts the morning sun.  It is designed in levels so it is possible to walk round at different heights.  Looking out to the mountains and the trees in the surrounding area is quite beautiful.Borobudur is a truly impressive location for its 1200 year old age.",2016-05-02,Business,2016-04,lesotho,-29.6039267,28.3350193
,5.0,"I stayed in town at Lotus 2 and walked in right at 6 a.m. on a Monday, and quickly walked and climbed to the top, where there were about 50 people still on the $30 sunrise tour which starts at 4.30. I regretted not going on that because the May sky above the caldera and volcano was exquisite at sunrise. Still at 6 a.m. the sun is just hitting the top level and the caldera is misty, just gorgeous.  It was also wonderfully cool. I didn't get a guide because I prefer my own pace and path, and if you know the story of Buddha you get an idea what the incredible carvings are about.  There's a great view of the temple and caldera from the hill next to the art gallery (which itself has a film of the eruption and is worth seeing for Javanese crafts).  By 7.30 the temple becomes like a shopping mall and after the magic of the early morning it was a bit of a shock to the system.

A great driver with AC car is Mr. Eko Wahyu who speaks good English and knows everwhere to go around Borobudur and Yogyakarta - contact (+62 )858 7830 5760 or email putri.gibran12@gmail.com  Best to visit Borobudur temple early in the morning to avoid the crowds, the extra price for a sunrise ticket may not be worth it in April as often cloudy but it does give you a few hours to see and take photos before hundreds of people arrive. Best to come Monday to Friday as less people and at the weekends more locals and school groups come and want to practice English asking basic questions, after the tenth time it's a bit wearying! Also be prepared to be continually asked to have a group photo or selfie with Indonesians, you can be asked many times. It is worth a temple guide unless you have a good guide and you can rent umbrellas to keep off the sun/rain. You can go down and eat at the Manohara hotel within the temple grounds as a non-guest if you want to come back to the temple later. To avoid the endless tourist shops on leaving go straight ahead past the first exit after the museum and follow the next set of exit signs, its a lot shorter. The boat museum in the temple grounds has minimal English signage, the temple museum is a bit better and has a few interesting old photos both included in your ticket but could be a lot better. If you are interested in Buddhist temples then Candi Mendut close by is worth a visit and cycling around the quiet villages is very nice, the traffic is not so busy nor fast. You can see a lot of rural activities or you can join a cycle tour if preferred and the local restaurants are much cheaper than the tourist ones on the main road back to Yogyakarta..",2016-05-01,Solo,2016-04,australia,-24.7761086,134.755

Many of the statues are broken, destroyed and incomplete due to natural degradation, the volcano eruption and human.When we were there, there are many many tourists and student groups as well, making the place rather crowded. It was a really sunny day as well, so staying for too long is quite uncomfortable. As we exit the temple grounds, there are a lot of souvenirs sellers that approach and follow us, not a big problem as long as you politely reject their offers.There's also a museum that stores some of the artifacts recovered and have some paintings of the temple over the centuries.

It'd been cooler to see Borobudur surrounded by wilderness. Also, it costs 30$ for non Indonesians. I am all up for making attractions cheaper for residents but he price was ridiculous considering that Angkor Wat in Cambodia charges 20$ and Bagan in Myanmar 10$, being those last two way more impressive.Keep in mind that in the morning there is a lot of mist but if you stay late enough, you get to see one of the volcanoes right in front of Borobudur.",2016-04-23,Friends,2016-04,spain,39.3260685,-4.8379791

So your ticket is not a day pass its for one entry only- what a rort, totally impractical. Indonesia needs to sort this out and look for greater flexibility. Also Indonesia is not a Buddhist country and does not respect the Buddhist temples like an Asian Buddhist country would. For example all visitors should be wearing long sleeves and pants, you should not sit or touch the monument, wearing shoes is a no no usually and I even saw a guy sitting in a lord Buddha pose for a photo seriously what is wrong with people- you don’t see people pretending to be jesus on the cross, try that in sri lanka , Thailand or indiaAlso you need to take your passport, some people were asked to complete their passport details in a ledger before being sold the tickets for entry none tells you this, going for sunrise means you are there very early but its nice to watch the sky getting lighter.The site lives up to the hype and is amazing – the museums are a waste of timePlenty of security but they do nothing but talk on their phones Beautiful site gardens etc one of the few places in Indonesia not covered in rubbish and cig buttsThe 2kms stretch of vendors is an exaggeration – and they can easily be avoided by taking the paths to the hotel when exiting",2016-04-19,Couples,2016-03,malta,35.8885993,14.4476911

First you will go up to this hill called Setumbu hill to see sunrise from the top, it's like 30 minutes from the hill to borobudur, try to find a cheap tour from your hostel or something you won't regret it.Borobudur to me is like a perfect place for you to just relax and enjoy this amazing temple surrounded by nature. There you can see the mount merapi and all those green view as far as the eyes can see. Tranquility at its best especially in the morning. Why morning? It gets very hot by 9AM so you would want bit more of a chill in the morning. The thing is, there will be a lot of school kids who will approach you and ask for a selfie with you and interview you. Why? Because these kids are from many parts of Java and they had never seen ""Foreigners"" in the flesh before and that's why they get so excited to see you. They'll ask for your permission to be interviewed because the reason why they visit borobudur is for their school tasks so it's their only chance to speak to the native. You'll find it cute with some school girls approaching you embarrassed and always find it hard to speak the first time. But once you agree to be interviewed? All school kids will aim at you.Of course it's nice to help them but it's also important for you to enjoy what borobudur has to offer in such short time before it gets boiling. There are several layers until you reach the top of borobudur. Those kids will be up on top of the borobudur, try to find a quiet spot in one of the layers put your shades on, music on, there you can enjoy borobudur without getting interrupted by these kids. If you don't want them to take a photo with you, just say no politely, they will understand.Oh, if you want to know a bit more about borobudur, try to ask for a guide who can explain everything the story of Borobudur. Another tips is, wear something that covers your knee of maybe just knee length, they will give you a nice sarong to cover it so it adds the excitement of visiting borobudur. You can wear something that covers your shoulder too. Flip flops are the best options. and do not forget to go to the restroom first before you enjoy borobudur, trust me, the loo is far from the temple area.255.000 rupiahs is the entrance fee, but if you happen to have your student card you can get 50% off. Do not forget to bring your student card! I mean it! Enjoy x",2016-04-15,Friends,2016-02,germany,51.1638175,10.4478313

"Gahanna, OH",5.0,"I took a Holland America cruise (Volendam) and it stopped at Semarang for the day. A group of us (i.e. 14 people) booked a ""private day tour"" to 9 hour tour to Borobudur with a local tour company for $93 pp. Our ""private tour"" was cheaper, and in my opinion better than any tour that the ship sold. Our price included the van driver, guide, lunch, taxes, port fees (buses/vans have to pay a free to get inside the port area to pick up passengers), and admission. If you are doing a day trip to Borobudur off a cruise ship, two pieces of advice: 1) don't try it on your own, and 2) don't do it without a police escort. Due to the traffic having the police escort was invaluable. Our van was able to use both sides (and the middle for that matter) of the road and went right through the traffic lights - no matter the color.The road and/or traffic to/from Semarang - Borobudur can be terrible.  With the police escort we made the usual 3 hour trip in just under 2 hours (each way). The ship used a police escort for their busses too. The van that they used was very comfortable and actually had 18 or 19 seats, i. e. nobody was crowded and the air conditioning worked fairly well. Also, the tour guide was very good.The Borobudur Temple is all that it is cracked up to be. Maybe it is not one of the ""One of the Seven Wonders of the World""; however, it is just as impressive as some of the actual ""7 Wonders"" etc. It is an UNESCO site and (if it isn't) should be on your ""bucket list"".

As the ground warmed, a mist rose and slowly enveloped us and then passed on. Then we sat and took in the vista. As we descended, the heavens opened and we were drenched - but it was still worth looking around at the rest of the temple and learning a bit of its history. It was the rainy season so lots of people were around to rent an umbrella to keep off the worst of the rain - and we soon dried out.

"Singapore, Singapore",4.0,"The temple is impressive and I'm glad that I finally made the visit, since I have heard so much about it and I have been dreaming to visit it.However, as a Buddhist, I was actually a bit disappointed. Having visited Sukhothai (Thailand) the week before, I was expecting a serene and deeply religious atmosphere, similar to what I experienced in Sukhothai. As the saying goes, ""expectations lead to disappointments"". Thanks to its fame, Borobudur temple attracts too many tourists and as a result it is crowded and noisy, especially at the top level.On the good side, Borobudur temple is majestic, huge, and very well preserved. In terms of architecture, Borobudur temple itself can easily beat all the temples in Sukhothai historical park. As the levels are stacked up like a pyramid, the top level offers an excellent view of the surrounding landscape, especially Mount Merapi to the east. The carvings at the lower levels, which display Buddhist teachings and stories, are amazingly well preserved. Even if you are a non-Buddhist, you will be awed by the grandeur and intricate workmanship. As I said, my disappointment mainly comes from the huge number of tourists. Unlike Sukhothai historical park (or other Buddhist sites like Angkor Wat, Shwedagon Pagoda, etc) where people are spread over a large area, Borobudur only has 1 temple and everybody is concentrated on and around that one and only temple. Everybody comes to Borobudur just to see the one and only Borobudur temple. (Don't be deceived by the empty gardens around the temple after you pass through the ticket office. Nobody comes to Borobudur to see gardens.)Secondly, what makes Borobudur different from other Buddhist sites like Sukhothai, Angkor Wat and Shwedagon is that Borobudur is in a non-Buddhist country. In Buddhist countries, the locals tend to have great respect for Buddhist monuments, and foreign visitors tend to follow the respectful behaviours of the locals. In Borobudur, most of the locals are non-Buddhists, so they have little understanding of Buddhism and they merely see Borobudur as one big tourist attraction like Disneyland. Many of them talk loudly, many walk in front of you when you take photos, some wave their selfie sticks around (watch out!), and some of them even have picnics on the steps. There was a small group of Buddhists chanting at the top level of the temple, but their presence was overwhelmed by the hundreds of tourists walking around them. The spiritual atmosphere that I felt in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar is mostly absent in Borobudur.That being said, there are some steps that you can take to make your visit more meaningful. One strategy is to visit the temple early. You can fork out extra money to join the sunrise entry at 04:30am. If you don't want to spend extra, or if the weather is too cloudy or rainy for sunrise (like my case), you can enter the park at 6am. It's quite a distance from the main road to the ticket office, and another distance from the ticket office to the temple (a 5-10 minutes walk if you walk fast). Once you reach the temple, climb the stairs to the top level first, because the top level is the most popular spot and many people tend to linger there for a long time. Most guidebooks recommend you to see the carvings at the lower levels first, and then go up one level at a time, because that is the supposed sequence in Buddhism (from the ""everyday"" world at ground level to ""nirvana"" at the top). If you do that, the top level will be crowded with people when you reach. Once you reach the top level, try to take as many pictures as possible, before the tour groups start coming in after 6:30am. By 7am, the top level will be pretty crowded. You can then slowly see the carvings at the lower levels at your own pace. Most tour groups go directly to the top level so the lower levels are pretty quiet, even after 7am.Unlike Sukhothai or Angkor Wat where ""exit"" means exit, Borobudur forces you to walk ultra-long distances through rows and rows and rows of shops before you can finally reach the exit, and even after that, there is another long walk through a huge market before you can actually see the main road. Parts of the exit route can be crowded, so take this into consideration and plan sufficient time if you have an appointment to catch (e.g. bus departure or hotel check-out).",2016-04-02,Solo,2016-03,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992

But since we haven't been and we didn't have time to do it so we did it anyway. And turn out to be really awesome !We went from hotel in Yogya at 4am, got to the Manohara hotel at 5am and buy entrance ticket there. We went with a guide provided at the hotel, and they give us flashlight. It was cool morning but not very cold and no wind, so nice..Going up the temple is rather scary for me who is scared of height.. but I managed to get on the top platform after several times taking a break to catch my breath. Some of the stairs are taller than my knee. The scenery is so breathtaking, layers of cloud, mist, trees.. and when the temple is awaken by the kiss of the sunlight, birds are busy flying to catch dragonflies.. it was magical.It turned out to be best decision we made. We recommend to take the sunrise tour for you to enjoy Borobudur temple to the fullest.It was really tranquil people were whispering and we can hear the sound of the nature.. wonderful..No screaming tour leaders on their loud microphones, no need to fight for the perfect picture spots, you can take your time looking at all the carvings without hundreds of school kids around you. The big groups started coming at around 7 and the tranquility disappears.So, we did have to pay a lot, but the sunrise tour is hundred times worth it.The only thing I miss was my sleep.",2016-03-29,,2016-03,indonesia,-2.4833826,117.8902853

Timaru,5.0,"It's a fact that there will never be another Borobudor, and it's truly spectacular.  It's very well-kept.  With passing of time, and the fact that it was bombed by extremists more than a decade ago, Borobudor is still standing.  Metaphorically, this is a testament to the values of people here in Indonesia particularly in Java.  Javanese here are tolerant and accepting.  It's common here to see mosques that are built with Hindu architectural cues, and you would get to see Chinese Temple being placed next to a mosque.  It's simply a way-of-life here.  Back to Borobudor, as you walked around the Buddha statues, you would also get to see murals of the origin of Buddha, and also about the story of Java itself.  Some of the statues at the Temple happened to be Chinese traders that came to this shore centuries ago!  It's been said that Borobudor is discovered by Sir Stamford Raffles, but local people would say to you logically that local villagers have known the Temple all along, and it so happened that when Stamford Raffles was the Governor of Java that he wrote a story about it.  The reality of the matter is that he never actually visited the site but his assistant.  Standing on the pinnacle of Borobudor, I tried to imagine the Kingdoms that had come and gone.  Java is such a melting pot of cultures and it's an assuring thing talking to the locals, of their proclaimation of affection for it despite that it's a non-Muslim relic (unlike the Buddha statue that's been bombed into pieces at Bamiyan).  To visit Borobudor is to give you a condense historical lesson of Java itself.  A must-do in anyone's bucket list.  Another profound thing that I have learnt from the local people is that whilst many yoga pant ladies are posing themselves meditating onsite to symbolise peace, peace according to them could be found anywhere.  One aspect that might ruin your visit there would be persistent hounding of souvenir sellers that wouldn't let you be.  That being said, my ever practical guide told me that everyone's doing their best to make a living.  It happened to be the choice of souvenir sellers to do what they do, and he urged me to have more compassion (so true).  Last but not least, in response to one of the reviews written here about them being stalked by Indonesian students, it's a novelty for them to have their pictures taken with overseas visitors.  Indonesians are immensely proud of their motherland, and they are appreciative when we visit Indonesia.  This is their way of proclaiming their gratitude by sharing humanity with a smile, and there's nothing wrong with it.  Come here early, but during rainy reason, refrain from doing the sun rise tour because you might not get to see the sun at all.  Later in the morning, school groups start coming in droves and you might need to fend off premium viewing sites from the selfies crowd!!",2016-03-17,Solo,2016-03,new zealand,-41.5000831,172.8344077

Make sure you don't leave after 4am as the ride is about an hour. Upon arrival, you'll have to go through security scans before purchasing your tickets. Price of the Borobudur Temple for SUNRISE is:- Foreigners IDR400k- Locals IDR270kI would suggest you to go for the sunrise because:1. If you're already there, why not? 2. Its a good view (provided the weather is good)3. Before 8am its not open from the other gates where locals swarm in and in large groups! They came in while we were still at the temple and the temple basically was very very crowded and yes you won't have a good picture. Things to take note:- Go earlier to get yourself a good place to catch the sunrise- There were locals in school uniform that came in groups, seem like they were on a school excursion. However there were other groups that were not in their school uniforms. We weren't sure of our safety because they tried to come very close to us and followed us during our stay in the temple. We couldn't be sure if we have unknowingly became a ""target"" or they were just innocent locals in their adolescence who were curious about foreigners. They did asked for a few photos with us and I had agreed to. My friends on the other hand were pretty skeptical of their intention as we were being followed around. There were staff around who would make sure visitors do not do the ""DO NOTS"" but they did not tell the teenagers not to follow foreigners. We felt as though we were being stalked. Would appreciate if were notified earlier from the hotel staffs about such behaviour so that we wouldn't get a shock when we were being followed around.",2016-03-16,Friends,2016-03,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992

This incredible structure was unearthed by Stanford Raffles in 1812, what a sight it must have been. Situated on high ground with stunning views of a neighbouring (active) volcano the location alone is enough to inspire without even considering the wonderful Temple. The advice to visitors is, out of respect to the temple, to walk around it 3 times before climbing to higher the levels. I strongly recommend you do this, I am not a spiritual person but I certainly enjoyed a spiritual experience on my way around. Find out for yourself! The temple itself is a wonder of detail, look and you will see more and more. Amazing!The only downside is the ambush of curio sellers that will pounce on you from the moment you step out of your car. They do not go into the confines of the temple but will be waiting for you when you emerge, you then have to run the gauntlet of an entire market of sellers on the way to the exit.

I've visited this temple many times, at different times and weather, and for my the most ideal time is during less-cloudy sunrise. I suggest you to stay in Manohara Borobudur since this is the only hotel that provide direct sunrise tour (if you stay in other hotels, you would need pay extra and probably wake up earlier).If you visit this temple at regular hour, Borobudur would be very crowded since this is a popular destination for local school tours. Be careful if you visit this temple during rainy season, since the stairs and the ground could be slippery. It's better to wear hat and comfortable footwear. This temple might not be very suitable for elderly or younger children due to the steep stairs.

It is pyramidal in structure with each level possessing a powerful message, in beautiful bas-reliefs, of the ascent of a human being from the base passions, to the passions of the mind to  Buddhahood, depicted in statues in a state of equanimity. The final Stupa is the attainment of Nibbana where Karma, the fuel for rebirth has ceased completely.There were numerous school children and we were also privileged to see a high ranking Tibetan Lama who, we were told, undertakes this pilgrimage every year.The complex is well looked after and the care, attention, respect paid by Indonesians to this venerated Buddhist complex, we hope, will be continued as it is the sign of tolerance of other Religions.",2016-03-03,Couples,2016-02,australia,-24.7761086,134.755

That's probably why there were extremely few foreign tourists and hordes of local tourists. The latter treat the site like an amusement park; despite a number of signs forbidding in many climbed and touched and littered the structure with not even the slightest bit of respect to be shown. Maybe because  none of them are Buddhist and therefore attach no significance to the history and spiritual clout this place holds; the same surely would not be allowed to happen at a Masjid open to tourists.

"Los Angeles, CA",4.0,"One of the reasons I took a Holland American cruise in Indonesia was the opportunity to see Borobudur. Based on what I read on the cruise boards, they suggested it would be best to take the ship's excursion, rather than making private arrangements, because of the traffic and the length of the journey to get to the temple. There were 18 buses in our entourage! The most entertaining part of the journey was the police escort, which got us whizzing through traffic at amazing speeds and angles. With flashing lights and sirens, everyone stopped or got out of our way. Like a ride at an amusement park. We also enjoyed the 30 minute train ride as part of the excursion.Unfortunately, when we arrived at the temple (with 400 of our closest friends), there were already many people there. Although the tour guide did find a few spots where he could talk and we could hear him, the tour allowed a mere 10-20 minutes after the guide's presentation to walk down the many stairs and return to the bus. Astounding that an all-day tour allowed virtually no free time at the temple. If you can arrange a private tour with assurances that you will get back in time to the ship, absolutely do so. Obviously if you are not on a cruise, you want to get there as early as possible - to avoid the larger crowds in the afternoon and to avoid the oppressive heat.

"Dongguan, China",5.0,"If you visit Yogyakarta, the 2 main cultural attractions are :  Borobudur and Prambanan temples, please buy the entrance  ticket for those 2 temples at the same time , it will save you 30% off the cost , ( as it costs roughly 25usd the entrance for each temple per person without any discount, it will be cheaper if you buy it at once ) but the ticket entrance will be available for 24hours, I advise you to visit Borobudur in the morning and end up with Prabamnan at the afternoon.Rent a car with driver for a day, it will cost 400 000 rupiahs more or less... For a day including gasoline, but not the parkings, which is 1 dollar a day.Borobudur is a wonderful temple 1 hour drive from Yogyakarta city, made by volcano stone with an amazing conception and assembling way ,surrounded by  green forest and jungle . The atmosphere of this place is very special, if you like exotic and Buddhism, this place make you feel connected with universe...what's a majesty place. Take a guide at the ticket entrance for (100 000 rupiah = 8 usd more or less) it will help you to have a really better understanding, the visit with the guide will last around 1 hour and half...very helpful.",2016-02-21,Couples,2016-02,china,35.000074,104.999927

"Johor Bahru, Malaysia",5.0,"We stayed at Manohara Hotel which is located in the compound of Borobudur. If you want to visit Borobudur, I really recommend to stay at least for a night here and do the sunset or Sunrise entry for :1. Discounted entry for sunrise or sunset entry 250k vs 400k2. Free 40 mins video on Borobudur. It explains the history and tells the carvings which makes what you see come alive3. Peace and quiet without the crowd during sunset or Sunrise entry4. It's free entry to Borobudur for as long as you stay here. We stayed 1 night and got entries for 2 days. 5. Separate entry so you don't get hassled by too many vendors. We went for the sunset entry but we went earlier at 4.30pm. The crowd especially at the top where the stupas are, were noisy and it was quite crowded. But come 5.15pm, sudden calm descends with only 5 of us there. The difference in the atmosphere was amazing. Definitely worth paying the extra. We were allowed to stay in until 6.20pm.Our mistake. ...we should have watched the video or visit the library before going in to pick up on the stories as we walked around it. The video is shown over and over again from 5pm-9pm, pretty much on demand basis. But we are going in again to check out the carvings and see if we can spot what the video has shown us. Unfortunately it was cloudy today so the sunset wasn't as spectacular but still beautiful especially when you are in such peaceful environment. This is one place that you should not miss. Do note that this is not recommended for those who has problem climbing steep stairs and strollers  (it is really steep, some steps are slight slightly more than a foot high).We walked out from the hotel turn left towards town. After the main Borobudur entrance, take a left. You will see a Juice Bar on the right. Really really good and cheap. Go get some. It's worth it. Juice costs between 5k-10k. Prices stated on the wall so you won't get fleeced.Keep going straight, you will see a BNI signage, right beside it, there is a stall selling fried duck and chicken. Really good. We paid 66k for 2 duck and 1 chicken meals. Not that cheap but reasonable. Make sure you taste the sambal (chilli paste)!",2016-02-19,Friends,2016-02,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823

Unfortunately, the day I went, the crowd was a heavy mix of locals and students; the number of people who came for the temple did not bother me, but the students that crowded every pathway, did. They were more interested in snapping selfish and wefies than of the temple, which again was fine, but if only it was not done at the temple because it hindered genuine interests in the temple. I believe the temple should up their management of the temple and limit the number of people up and in Borobudur. Such wonderful ancient structure should be treated with more care.

No, you can't take your car and cars need to be parked outside the temple area.For elderly or families with infant or those carrying baby stroller, you could request the guards to open the shortcut road (on the left side of the normal entrance) to get you to the first floor of the temple.I had my mother with me, so we had the chance to use this special road and it didn't require you to climb too many stairs to reach the temple.I suggest that you go around the temple from the right to the left and till the top peak.  The stupas where the Buddha sits in meditations are a must try to touch (but be careful cause the security is around and they won't let you climb the ancient stupa).The legend says, if the finger of your hand could reach the belly of the meditating Buddha, your future will be filled with richness and prosperity.

Although there was slight drizzle, the wet weather did not dampen our mood to see sunrise at the top of the temple. For a better understanding of temple and its history, do get a local guide (We got our both our Borobudur sunrise tickets and local guide from Mahohara hotel. do note that getting a guide after 6am is cheaper than getting a guide to accompany you up there for sunrise.)

"Singapore, Singapore",3.0,"Borobudur is well worth a visit.  From architectural, archeological and historical perspective it is in the first division along with Machu Picchu, Angkor Wat, the Great Pyramid and other premier sites of the ancient world.  Overall the profuse detail, perspectives and views are quite breathtaking.  It pays to scrutinise much of the detail as this helps one appreciate what an enormous achievement building Borobudur was and the equally stunning care for detail necessary to restore it to resemble its original state.  The approach and park-like layout are in tune with temple itself.  Three drawbacks tax the tolerance of serious visitors.  As is so often the case at Asian sites (and elsewhere) there are too many people milling around!  This cannot be helped.  The second adverse feature appalled me.  On leaving the temple itself, yet still within the complex, one has to walk through a covered avenue that makes up the usual market; tawdry goods and vendors assail you from all sides for about 500 metres.   Any awe/wonder concerning the temple is quickly dispelled!  The third adverse aspect was the difficulty in obtaining correct details of the costs of entry and mode of payment from the Web.  We ended up paying about 25% more than expected and were unable to pay in dollars, as expected.  Finally, there is a marked and suspicious absence of signs to the temple when you arrive by public transport.  In summary: the site is first rate and warrants World Heritage status; the last three defects noted above detract markedly from Borobudur.  These are such that the site should be stripped of its World Heritage status.",2016-02-12,Couples,2016-02,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992

The architecture of the temple contains many meaningful Buddhist details and each floor is different, with the top with covered Buddhas being the experience culmination. I rarely say this (almost never), but Borobudur is really breathtaking. If I am so impressed, why did I not give five stars? The reason is the pricing, which I find shameful. Indonesians pay IDR 30 000 (around USD 2.4) for a ticket, while foreigners are required to pay IDR 280 000 (around USD 21.00) - almost ten times more for exactly the same experience! Not only they decided to discriminate - they did not even bother to offer more premium experience for the price they demand (for example, a brochure or a guided tour).

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"I spent a quick weekend in Yogyakarta before going to Jakarta for work and made a list minute decision to do the sunrise visit to Borobudur. If you have the time I would suggest staying closer to the temple so you don't have to get up SUPER early. I was picked up from my hotel at 3:30 AM, arrived at the Manohara hotel (where you buy tickets) around 4:30 AM. And then made my way over to the temple. It was raining (they provide ponchos). While the weather was a bit upsetting at first it added to the ambiance of walking up the temple in the early hours of the day. The sunrise was at 5:40, but I strongly suggest heading over to the temple site earlier as the east facing side of the temple gets crowded.  My only regret is not better planning where I wanted to be for the sunrise. Loads of people  were everywhere and it made it hard to get a picture/enjoy the moment. Pros:- get in before public (made my experience much better than my visit the day before at Prambanan) - get to explore in early sunlight. Gets very hot during mid day. - head back to the Manohara after (& avoid the market) for snacks. Refreshment area has a nice view of the temple from far away. Cons:- costs more (400,000) - have to get up very early Cost:- 400,000 for sunrise ticket- 400,000 for driver for 5 hrs from YogyakartaOverall: you will be happy you went. Feels a bit touristy at times, but sunrise experience is very unique. A local guide isn't necessary.

Malaysia,5.0,"I think everyone will agree to say that Borobudur is the place to visit if you are in Yogyakarta. I would actually say that it is the place to visit if you are in Indonesia. How many of you know that this is the largest Buddihist temple in the world? And it is considered the second main attraction for tourist in Indonesia, just after Bali.Since there are already a lot of information about this venue I will write something it may be useful for the first timer of this temple:WHEN TO GO:The best period is definetelly during the dry season, which is from end April to late September. Although it will more crowded with tourists and harder to take pictures as you ususally see in googleI also prefer to take the sunset entrace package instead of the daily entrace. Reasons? 1 have less tourists, 2 the light for pictures is more suitable. Note that in Indonesia the sunset is at 6 pm, so not too late...HOW TO GO:My raccomandation is to hide a driver. The hotel may recommand a driver for Rp 600.000, which I think it is expencive. We managed to have a driver for Rp 350.000. Which also stopped to a silver factory along the way to check few local artifacts. WHAT TO WEAR:Definetelly you need to have confortable shoes. Not much to walk but the steps to the top are a bit steep. Nothing impossible, my 3 years old baby did it by himself. You want to have a cap during sunny days and water with you. SOUVENIRS:At the entrance/exit you will find some people trying to sell you stone statuettes. The bargaining will start from Rp 200.000. The art of dealing with it I leave it up to you.It's important to know that the correct price is no more than Rp 30.000 per piece. PRICE:As you can see from many picture the price is Rp 400.000 for foreigners Rp 270.000 for local and kitas holders and 250.000 if you have a room in hotel. Now, what is this hotel room story? I was surpriced when I fist arrived to the carpark of the temple. I almost scolded my driver. The entrance of the temple is through an hotel. Therefore if you have a room in this hotel the Sunset fee will be only Rp 250.000.TIPS:I dunno how much you spend for your room in Yogyakarta, however I would consider to sleep in this hotel knowing that the regular rate is Rp. 1.100.000 included of free entrance at the temple (day time from 6.00 am to 5.00 pm) worth Rp 270.000 to foreigners.",2016-02-06,Family,2016-02,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823

Make sure you check your compass in your phone which direction is east so that you won't miss the good spot to take pictures.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",5.0,"Even after doing a good amount of reading on TA and other sites, no amount of photos and descriptions can adequately describe this majestic temple. This colossal monument definitely has the 'WOW' factor. Yes, foreigners pay a much, much higher price than the locals, but this didn’t stop us from visiting.  I would recommend getting a local guide when you go around the temple to help you understand the ornately decorated relief panels, each with a story of its own.  I loved the incredible attention to detail on these panels. It can be very hot as you ascend the 6 six square terraces and 3 circular ones, so make sure you come adequately prepared. No eating is allowed on the monument. WCs are only available at the bottom of the complex.Also, as soon as you get down from the car in the car park, you will be approached by the many, MANY traders selling all sorts of things like umbrellas, caps, hand fans and such. If you don’t intend to buy any of this stuff, you must tell them a firm “NO”. Don’t just walk away as they will follow you or say “Later” as some these traders will wait for you at the exit. They can be very, very pushy and adamant which can be rather overwhelming. Also, if you are buying something, make sure you bargain. Don’t be stationary as you are bargaining, keep walking.All in all, I had a wonderful time in the temple.

"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",5.0,"Borobudur is stunningly beautiful.  It's like a fata morgana standing tall and proud in the middle of very green fields. The temple is wrapped around a small hill. So very solid. It was constructed between 750 and 850. As a Buddhist temple. And thereafter almost immediately forgotten due to change of political power and rise of Islam. Totally overgrown by the surrounding jungle, it lay forgotten until Sir Raffles (UK) arrived on the scene in mid 19th century. He got interested in local stories of huge temple hidden in the jungle. The Dutch did mega tree cleaning job. UNESCO recently restored at cost of USD 25 million! Climbing Borobudur is spiritual as well as physical. It's 120 by 120 meters and some 38 meters high. There are good steps leading from the world of suffering/greed to Nirvana. Bur rather than getting there in one go, which would be too easy, one is supposed to walk each of the 9 tiers - which we did - 6 square ones and 3 circular ones. Doing so enables one to contemplate and appreciate the very fine stone carvings and the views. It's also easier on legs and lungs!! A light breeze picks up closer to Nirvana! Highly needed for dripping pilgrims! ‎ On the last 3 tiers are series of Stupas - each with a Buddha figure inside. The top stupa was supposed to have an unfinished Buddha figure inside - as perfection is the Lord's. The lower levels are square. The top levels are circular, signifying the never ending road to Nirvana. The top is lower now, because of an earthquake... I felt humbled by the beautiful friezes, speaking of expert craftsmanship, and serene Buddha sculptures, remnants of the devotion and skills ‎of people long gone. Wonder whether they could anticipate visitors from all creeds coming to visit 1200 years later? Not to mention the coordination of huge workforce! There are many tourists, of course! Good for local economy. We had private local tour. Also good for local economy and for us. Away from maddening crowd of bus tours. Getting there takes about 3 hours one way from Semerang, because of the sheer amount of vehicles. Indonesia has 245 million inhabitants. There are reportedly some 110 million vehicles around of which 85 million are motor cycles.",2016-01-27,Couples,2016-01,ethiopia,10.2116702,38.6521203

When you arrive you either walk for 10 mins to the temple or take an ojek.-we arrived around 10:30. It was not crowded at all, so it is not necessary to take a sunrise tour for this reason (althought we went off season)-don't rush to the top but take your time at every level-bring lots of water, sunblock, a cap and an umbrella-student card gets you 50% discount (we bought a combined ticket for prambanan and borobudur which is valid for two days, costs were 210.000)",2016-01-27,Friends,2016-01,germany,51.1638175,10.4478313

They really need more security at the highest step of the temple.Sadly, the one who doing such things are all local tourists. While the international tourists being very careful about not to break the historical site, local tourists didn't care about such thing and doing anything they like.

"Penang Island, Malaysia",5.0,"Headed to Borobudur by public bus from Malioboro, Yogya city. It's quite straight forward, ride Transjogja 2a or 2b (Idr 3600 per person) to Jombor station, then Cemero Tunggal (average about Idr 20000 per person, you need to bargain with the conductor) to Borobudur. There is no air conditioning on the Cemero Tunggal, but still tolerable. The other thing to note about public transport is the time taken will definitely depend on traffic, so make sure you have ample time. It took us more than 3 hours going, but only about 2 hours to get back to Malioboro.We stayed a night in Borobudur. Due to the the rainy season while we were there, didn't manage to see the sun rising as its was quite cloudy. Nonetheless, it was a thoroughly enjoyable visit. A must see, as everyone says. We were in awe at the temple's historic architectural brilliance and beauty, and the very serene surrounding scenery. Both the temple and its surroundings are very well kept and clean. During midday, it gets very crowded and noisy (can also be very hot due to the afternoon sun), so I would suggest getting in early, or staying till before it closes.

Many foreign visitors were also surprised about the new entrance fees, but entered the site, having to ride to this place about 2 hours from Yogya. Of course the local authorities know this, they think everyone will enter Borobudur having travelled so long. Well, I did not. I talked to local tour guides and locals working there. Locals say, the raise is not good for them, tourists are getting a wrong impression of Java and its people. Especially the tour guides expect fewer tourists to come just because of the increased fees. No need to explain, what fewer tourists would mean to central Java region. I was supported by the tourguides complaining to the local officer in charge and after being denied entry, my whole group of 4 people boykotted the site and went to a smaller temple site nearby.

It's now clean(er) you can explore the temple rather peacefully without being followed by souvenir sellers. I recommend hiring an official guide from the temple (approx USD 8) to tell you the full story of Buddha which's carved on the temple's wall. The tour lasts about 90 minutes so bring plenty of water to keep you hydrated during the tour as it can get really hot after 8 a.m.  You are going to have to walk through approximately 2 km of souvenir shops when you exit the temple before you can reach the parking lot. However, you can always take the  ""andong"" ride (a traditional horse drawn carriage) back to the parking lot, which takes only about 10 minutes and cost only Rp. 75.000,- (about USD 6).

There appear to be a few Islamic prayer centres within the grounds or very nearby and the azan rings out 5 times a day through loudspeakers. Unfortunately, many of the muezzins in this area appear to be tone deaf and the azans ring out somewhat out of tune. Hearing the azan when on the Borobudur surrounded by multitudes of domestic tourists in headscarves is an interesting juxtaposition of Central Java's Buddhist past and Islamic present.

"Sydney, Australia",5.0,"Borobadur is humbling and breathtaking. Be warned-it's a tourist trap, as is any place you go sightseeing to. As always, there are ways around. First and foremost, Borobadur is stunning.  Wear walking shoes, bring water, pause to notice the detail in the rock carvings and the story they tell, and take your time. Many people sprint up the steps, but I  recommend drinking everything in.At the terminal/bus interchange (the entrance to the UNESCO park), you'll find a sea of tuktuks and taxis, people willing to drive you around in their pedal-powered sedan, or their motorised chair. Use them. There's nothing worse than paying an over priced tourist company for a service where the labourer doesnt see the cash.We arrived in the morning (the earlier the better, to beat the crowds and the heat), and found ourselves a driver. He became our own private chauffeur and attached himself to us for the day, for a price we agreed upon at the start. (Pay upfront if you can). This pleased him, and he took us to a restaurant off the side of the road for breakfast, which we treated him too as well. Moral of the story: treat your guide well and they'll take good care of you. He then drove us to Mendut and Pawon. Both are temples part of the Borobadur complex and easily the highlight of my Borobadur excursion, even though they weren't the main site. The trees there are as old as the temples themselves, and the sites are less crowded. Mendut and Pawon are a definite MUST SEE. Beware that at Borobadur, it's run like a theme park. My Indonesian father gained entry for a quarter of the price of my ticket as a foreigner, but our personal driver told me to flash my student concession card, which they honour, so take whatever concession cards you have for a discount.  Be prepared to be completely harassed by hawkers and people selling trinkets. 1. Don't buy the first thing you see. 2. Don't flash your cash. 3. Respect them, the seller may be aggressive, but they're human. These are the things I remember from Borobadur.

Seeing the actual sunrise (or set for that matter) is extremely weather dependent, it was overcast when we visited and did not get to see the sunrise. The sunrise shouldn't be the only magical sight - in fact we enjoyed seeing the pre-dawn mountain backdrop so much that we wished the sun wouldn't come out!We were surprised that ticket purchase and entry was commercialized through the Manohara hotel.

For photographers, this is a great opportunity for stunning photos of both sunrise and the temple complex as the light hits just right. The crowds may get in the way during holidays as this is a destination for both tourists and locals alike.Regular entrance fee is around US$20 but costs a bit more if you're going for the sunrise.

Take a stroll around each level and notice the difference in the stupas and the carvings on the walls.Once you get back down, stand back and admire the majesty of this large temple complex. You will be in awe! Dont forget to take a photo with a large rock with the Borobudur name on it and signature of the president.One downside to this is they sort of ""force"" you to walk through the shops area when you are exiting the temple.

"Perth, Western Australia",3.0,"Borobudur is in a beautiful location and is a remarkable structure but if you had to make a choice between Ankor Wat and Borobudur for  once in a lifetime experience, choose Ankor Wat.  Its is easier to get to, entry is a fraction of the price and the area is about 100 times greater! Borobudur costs INR280,000 per person (AUD28.00) which is ten times the local rate, but for that at least you get a form of VIP entry area and the overall area and gardens are very well maintained and sign-posted.  The views over the surrounding hills and mountains are beautiful and the area could be very tranquil and spiritual, but it is extremely crowded, with little opportunity to achieve any degree of tranquility (certainly at 10.00am) and does require walking substantial distances before you get to the temple and start the climb.Our car ride took ninety minutes to get there and about the same to get back.  The absolute worst feature of the place is having to leave through a labyrinth of hawkers and touts, where you are channelled through about 1km of traders, in very hot conditions with huge crowds.  You can't avoid this and after you have finished what should be an enjoyable experience, you have to face this nightmare.  if you have rented a car and driver by the hour, as we had done, you are paying for the privilege of fighting your way through this place.  After walking for about 800m, zig-zagging though the stalls, you see daylight and come across a small museum with a boat in it, but don't raise your hopes yet - you are back into it again for about another five hundred or so meters.  Then, daylight, and you start to go to the exit back to the car park, but wait!  There's more, and more and more!!  Never have we seen anything like this anywhere else in our travels.As a suggestion to the administration, if you have to pay INR280,000 to get in, at least make an express exit for people who don't want to be exposed to this.  Overall, I would have to say that for us, the almost six hours from Jogjakarta and return was not a particularly pleasant experience and was spoilt by the end of the visit to the temple.

"Jakarta, Indonesia",4.0,"The Borobudur temple was truly a monument that symbolises the powerful devotion of the ancient Indonesians. I would recommend visiting the temple during the sunrise at about 5 AM (5:30 Sunrise) because the sunrise just makes the already beautiful temple more magnificent and it's not as crowded as it is on 9 AM above. The carvings on the walls are also amazing along with the view of a dense jungle. To think this monument was consumed by the jungle before it was discovered in 1814. Hiring a guide is very useful for foreigners, but guidebooks such are more useful. The draw backs were that I was VERY ANNOYED by the seller of souvenirs outside the temple complex, I Know they have a harsh life, I know they have trouble with money, but it's not a reason to force someone to buy something they don't really want, whether it was through threats or through making someone feel guilty if not purchasing the souvenirs.

The structure was lost for many years, and it was restored fairly recently. This is Indonesia's single most popular tourist attraction. The bas relief are interesting but many of them are unlikely to be meaningful unless you have an expert knowledge of Mahayana Buddhism.

It is quite small of course compared to Angkor Wat but for me, I am in Indonesia and it's the most visited monument in there so I am very happy having seen it in person.

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"It was 4 am. I got up from the creaky bed and dragged up Alison and Charlotte. We were ready to head to Borobudur and experienced it's famous sunrise view. The hotel we resided at was Manohara Resort, the nearest hotel to the World's famous UNESCO World Heritage site and offered free access into the temple (Foreigner fees-Adult: USD $20, Child: USD $10). But the hotel charged a separate fee for it's sunrise and sunset view (Foreigner fees-Adult: IDR 380 000, In-house Guest (Adult): IDR 230 000, In-house Guest (Child above 5 years old): IDR 175 000).At the temple gate, the security guards would perform a check through our belongings before letting us in. We could see a number of people already making their way into the temple ground. We were puffing and panting as we clambered up the steep stairs to the top tier of Borobudor. It must be the morning dense air(and of course our lack of exercise :-p).There was already a crowd when we reached the top. The recce on the day before had came helpful again as we took up a strategic position to witness the sunrise. The sun was supposedly to raise from the east at the direction of Mount Merapi. After settling Alison and Charlotte on a good place beside a stupa, I decided to take a short walk round to savor the morning scene. As most of the people were focusing to see the impending sunrise at the eastern end, the rest of the temple premise was almost empty. The seemingly endless stupas overlooked the surrounding environment. Some might not know that a mediating Buddha statue resided in each and every of the stupas. Few of the stupas have actually been ""un-covered"" to reveal the Buddhas within. There was a shroud of mist settling above the forest surrounding the temple, adding to the already serene atmosphere of the temple.There was a commotion when the golden rays started to appear behind the still smoking Mount Merapi. I could finally comprehend why the sunrise view at Borobudur was considered one of the twenty-seven places to see before you die. The yellow rays filtered through the still active volcano and cast upon those on the top of Borobudur. If ""Enlightenment"" has another meaning, it might actually refer to this moment of time. The scene was stunningly beholding. Although the sun was covered by the cloudy sky, it did not mar the beautiful moment.The day crowd began to arrive in number at around 8 am. It was also getting hot and we felt it's time to leave the temple. I have been wanting to visit the temple on numerous occasion but did not do so due to various reasons. There was a sense of achievement when I could finally stand upon the temple and witnessed the famous sunrise.  Borodudur did not fail my expectation.

Calgary,5.0,"We visited Borobudur from a recommendation by everyone who's visited Indonesia. When we pulled into the lot, we were immediately swarmed by vendors who were persistent and almost irritating, though understandably so – it's their living. After escaping them and purchasing our tickets – a slightly dreadful process, as the international pricing is 7x more than the local pricing – we passed through the gates and made our way to the temple. And then everything changed.Nothing can prepare you for the scale and sense of awe that Borobudur inspires. It's over a thousand years old, and indescribably beautiful. We entered the temple on the much less crowded south side to begin our ascent of its levels, walking a lap of each. From relief tapestries to Buddha statues, each level provides a different sense of wonder and beauty. At the top, the view surrounding the temple runs for miles: hills carpeted in palm trees, mountains, small residences, and the manicured gardens of the Borobudur property are all visible.As we reached the upper levels, we spotted rainclouds in the distance, between the mountains and hills. We sat and stared for at least half an hour, trying to soak it all in before realizing that we should probably start a descent, otherwise we might get soaked.Upon exiting the temple grounds, we were funnelled through a maze of vendors, all hawking similar products and souvenirs.

Cebu,5.0,"Candi Borobudur is photogenic any time of the day. Nonetheless, it is better to go there first thing in the morning to avoid the heat and the crowd. I was there very early and I almost have the temple to myself. It was very serene ... and cold! Bring a light coat or wrap for warmth against the morning chill. There are guards patrolling the temple itself and the surrounding grounds so don't be afraid if you are visiting alone and got there very early.Foreign tourists pay a more expensive entrance fee. They don't accept USDs so do prepare the Indonesian Rupiah equivalent of US$20.00. You'll get a complimentary small water bottle, a hot cup of coffee or a cold glass of orange juice. The temple has nine levels, the ninth being the Nirvana. The first 6 levels are considered hell. So be sure to reach at least the 7th level. The Borobudur is not as big as the Angkor Wat, not even by half. That being said, the climb is very doable and not steep and there are hand rails for the stairs. Just take your time and you will definitely reach nirvana :) Now, an advice in dealing with the touts/souvenir sellers: there are many of them along the long walk from the entrance (where you pay the entrance fee) towards the temple itself. They sell pictures (postcards) and what have you. Never ever say: ""Later"" to them otherwise, they will besiege you on the way down/out of the temple. They have amazing photographic memory of faces and they will accost you on the way out of the temple and say: ""You said ""later"" to me a while back.""On the way back to the car park, one has to walk through a long and meandering maze of stalls. As I was very early, the stalls were still closed. I could just imagine the frenzy when the stalls are all already open. The nirvana experience would definitely be obliterated. Should one really need to buy souvenirs, the ones sold in Yogyakarta are the same as the ones sold in the temple and way cheaper.",2015-11-12,,2015-09,philippines,12.7503486,122.7312101

To get to the temple site I suggested to take a tram, but actually we could also walk and enjoy the sceneries. When approaching the temple, each of us would be suggested to wear a blue-Borobudur-printed cloth tied to our waists. There were lots of people visiting the temple that time, so we had to take turn to go up. The stairs were steep and narrow.

India,5.0,"I have been reading the readers' queries regarding local transportation at Yogyakarta. Their anxiety is well-founded because the taxis in Indonesia operate on bargained price. Though such bargaining are not always to the visitor's disadvantage there is a perception in the minds of visitors that they are paying more. Visitors used to better levels of standardization carry this impression. It is therefore advisable to use public transportation wherever possible.Visitors to Borobudur have an option of taking a DAMRI bus. Though the buses are not of very good condition, once you are in the bus the things are fine. The bus stop of DAMRI is just outside the airport terminal building. Near this bus terminal and just across the road from international arrival hall are also a cafeteria lounge with several kiosks selling all kind of food. Though mostly it is seafood, there is good chance that every person could find something to eat for the day.At the DAMRI bus terminal, make sure which is the bus to MAGELANG and get into it when it comes. Make sure with the conductor that you are going to BOROBUDUR TEMPLE and therefore you have to get down at PALHAPANG. The task may not be all that easy as the bus get crowded on the way. If you are getting anxious you could always ask the fellow-passenger and you will surely find an answer. From Palhapang, hail a biker. There are so many motorcycle riders available for hiring. Negotiate a price for getting dropped at the temple entrance and off you go.Remember, if you have gone to Indonesia and if you have not visited Borobudur, you have not done justice to your visit.",2015-11-11,Solo,2015-03,india,22.3511148,78.6677428

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",3.0,We went up to the Borobudur Temple to see the sunrise from Yogja at 3.30am but it was not our luck because it had clouds. We waited for longer time to see the sun but thankfully it was really nice view with the Buddha Statue and Stupas and the sun as the background. It was not huge and can be explored by the elders but just need to be careful climbing up. The fees for Sunrise Borobudur was abit expensive 380K IDR. And the normal is 280K IDR. We had snacks and coffee (not impress with the coffee and tea) and souvenirs which is a short shawl with Borobudur Picture as the background. We would like to suggest to the Borobudur Management to manage and put a proper signage for the Exit because it was really confusing for the tourists and had to walk a long way back and forth (museum and stalls) just to find a way out.

"London, UK",3.0,"Everything we had read about Borobudur had compared it to Angkor Wat and Bagan, so I think that our expectations were a bit too high. This is a cool temple, and there are a number of excellent carvings, but it took us about 90 minutes to walk around the entire temple when spending time examining all of the carvings. I think that if you are really into Buddhist temples, this would be amazing, but in terms of scale, it is much smaller than Angkor or Bagan. I would also suggest getting there very early. We stayed on site and arrived promptly at 6am. The temple was largely empty and people were respectfully quiet for about an hour. Then a lot of school groups arrived to practice their English with tourists. The kids were really cute and incredibly excited/nervous to interview us, so it was a lot of fun. But about 20-30 different school groups showed up and they were loud. In addition, it was difficult to actually look at the temple because the different groups would continually interrupt to conduct their interviews. So, if you would like to view the temple in quiet and uninterrupted, I would definitely recommend an early start.

Sadly crowds make it very difficult to get  decent wide angle photographs.Also people need to be aware that it gets very hot here so avoid midday if you can.Exiting is more of an ordeal as there is only one way out which is through covered walkways surrounded by vendors selling what is basically ""cheap tat"" some of which such as the wire bicycles and miniature guitars etc are produced in China and sold all over the world.It takes at least 30 minutes to get through  this , some of the souveneers are reasonable but a majority is mass produced junk.Once back into the car park more vendors giving you the opportunity to buy hats postcards, drinks etc",2015-10-26,Couples,2015-10,united kingdom,54.7023545,-3.2765753

You should take a guide to understand what you are seeing or you will miss a good portion of what makes this place special. The story behind the pictures are amazing, a little like reading siddhartha. :)The sundown was better joke, it was nearly 20 minutes early and sank into the haze.Couldnt even see mount merapi. You kind of feel betrayed. Maybe the indonesians could finally pass a law against burning the rainforrest for palmoil monoculture... You can firsthand experience how that looks like when a state is too week to protect its citizens. Kind of makes you sad. Dont't expect too much and you wont be disappointed.From jogya the tour is about 600k.Guess it would be fair to give it 4 stars ignoring the haze. And its cooler than Prambanan in my eyes.",2015-10-22,Couples,2015-10,germany,51.1638175,10.4478313
,3.0,"The Temple is impressive and beautiful. A little smaller than I thought, but with many details and lots of charme. One can spend hours there. You should go and see it. But be aware: Because of the slowly ongoing restauration there are scaffoldings at the front of the temple. Nevertheless, the entrance fee is still off the roof. But still not high enough to scare off some of the tourists, that are covering the place. It is hardly possible to take a picture without some fellow visitor on it. Worst of it all is the way out. There is a maze of souvenir stands and the tourists are punched through the winding pathways like cattle. This insolence costs you about half an hour of your time and all of your nerves. If you try to leave the place through the entrance instead of the exit, the staff will try to stop you. My advice: still go. Most tours include the sunrise view from some mountain close to the temple. Since you can hardly see the temple from there even if it is not foggy, go directly to the temple. So you might have a chance to see it before the masses move in. Pre-entry, which is before 6 am costs extra. Bottom line: Gready people do not care to spoil your unique experience of this place. Get along with that and still have your fun or stay away and try some other sight.",2015-10-22,Couples,2015-10,,,

Germany,1.0,"Just to be clear: The temple itself is breathtaking. Everything else you will find around this place has nothing to do with Buddhism, so don't come here for a  spiritual experience. The UNESCO rightly criticises lack of oversight for the insane amount of vendor stalls and commercialization around the temple. On the way out they make you walk through a long maze of vendor stalls and hawkers. I sympathize with people relying on income from tourism but this really ruined it for me and smells like crude exploitation of a cultural resource.The sunrise experience was NOT worth it. To see the sunset or sunrise you have to purchase tickets from the Manohara Hotel at the park entrance. These tickets are considerably more expensive for foreigners (380k) than the regular tickets allowing entrance from 6am to 5pm. If you're willing to pay extra, be aware that you have to be lucky to actually see a sunrise. I went in September and saw none. The light was beautiful between 6 and 7 am (and too bright past 7am), so if you go, go as soon as the park opens, but don't pay for the sunrise ticket. Park employees told me there hasn't been a visible sunrise for an entire week, but chances at sunset are supposedly better if the weather is stable.The crowd was bearable for a Monday morning.For those coming from Yogyakarta: Going to Borobudur on your own motor bike is easy, but I personally wouldn't drive in the dark.

As you walk up the stairs you can stop and walk around each terrace - you could look at the sculpting work (which was unfortunately damaged by earthquakes) for days. From the top the views are amazing, the buddhas seated within giant bells are a once in a lifetime sight!With all that great stuff being said, it's really hard to leave the temple feeling just as great. To exit you have to walk through about 20 minutes worth of markets (which are actually nice, but are really hard to get out of). Being backpackers we really couldn't afford to add more trinkets to our luggage and for us the 20min walk filled us with guilt. I completely understand that it's peoples livelihoods, but I think it'd be better to have the markets separate from or before the temples.Temples cost about 300,000rp for adults, and 150,000rp if you're a student (local or international) with a valid student ID",2015-10-05,Couples,2015-09,new zealand,-41.5000831,172.8344077
"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",5.0,"Borobudur was constructed in the eighth and ninth century and is located in central Java. It was left to the ravages of nature in between the 12th and 14th century , most probably due to the volcanic eruption of Gunung Merapi. It was rediscovered by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1814 and thus started the preservation and restoration of this great ancient site. The temple is in the shape of a traditional Buddhist mandala, built in three tiers, with a square base with four entry points from the north, south, east and west direction., followed by five concentric square terraces, three circular platforms and at the tenth level, a monumental stupa.  According to Buddhist cosmology,  the universe is divided into three major zones. The first is Kamadhatu , the where human lives are depicted as unable to control sensual desires . Next level is Rupadhatu where  hundreds of reliefs on the walls depicting the Buddha's pervious lives and  his path to enlightenment. Total illustrations on the wall 1300. We were impressed by the compassionate nature of the Buddha from the wall reliefs especially of that when he was a monkey , a cow and an elephant. He was willing to sacrifice his life for the good of his friends.  The second level Rupadhatu , the world of forms where human lives are able to control desires yet still bound by forms. Next is the  Arupadhatu level. Look out for the stupas with the diamond shaped holes and square shaped holes. Looking inside you can see statues of the Buddha, most of the statues are headless. Do take a photo with the only two unenclosed stupas, standing beside the Buddha with your palms together. At the top of the three circular platforms lies a huge stupa, crowning the top of the temple. This is a fantastic photo corner.  There are no reliefs on the circular platforms , unlike the five concentric square terraces. Do enjoy watching sunrise and sunset.

I get to do my stuffs while helping a father provide for his family. But of course, still haggle a bit..) for a day to go to the temples and explore Merapi. I paid 600,000Rupia. In addition, the trip to Merapi volcano cost me 350,000. I had a guide that drove me around in a really old top-down jeepney. The whole volcano trip is a bit shaky and perhaps uncomfortable to some tourist as it is extremely dusty.The driver I had was very friendly and is also very good in taking pictures. As for the food, I ate only local. My favourite of course is that skinny fried chicken with rice. There's a lot of small stalls(night market) by the street where you can have them. I like eating this way coz its really Indonesian style, u've got to sit on the floor, cross your legs and enjoy your sumptuous meal. To wrap-up my trip, I took ""beck"" back to my hotel.

Our guide recommended an evening trip this time. We got picked up at 12 and visited two other smaller temples along the way. Apparently, these two temples and Borobudur were constructed in a straight line. So, by the time we got to Borobudur, it was about 2.45. We stayed until sundown. They allow you to stay at the top until around 5.15pm and the place closes at 5.30. I prefer the sunset to the sunrise. The evening sun against the Temple on the reverse side from the entrance is simply stunning. The colour was perfect for photography with the warm glow of the evening sun.For students' remember to bring your student cards. Half the price.

It is located about one hour outside of central Yogyakarta by car.  We hired a driver to take us there.  Not to worry; prices in Indonesia are incredibly low.  We paid the equivalent of about $10 U.S. dollars.  It is ridiculously worth that price.  The huge temple –– built in the 9th century –– consists of a gigantic square structure, layered upward in pyramid-fashion, every side covered with incredible bas-reliefs telling the story of the Buddha's life and teachings.  If your legs are in good shape and you are capable of climbing steep stairs, it is not extraordinarily difficult to get to the top of the four-story structure, and enjoy the incredible view of the surrounding countryside and mountains.

In the quietness of early morning, the highest place in the temple actually makes me feel grounded to the mother earth.My suggestion is to separate the trip, the one with kids (younger than 12 years old) and the one when you need to recharge your soul. If you want to have a moment for yourselves, limit the people going with you and come in very early in the morning. You can enjoy the sunset at one of the Hill surrounding the temple. The local unofficial guide (with motorbike) will be able to guide you to go there with some fee (negotiated). If you're traveling from Jogjakarta, it will need around 2 hours before sunset time to reach the hill (around 15-30 minutes uphill drive from the Temple). So, yes you have to leave Jogjakarta hotel around 3.30 am.The park and the temple itself will be opened for public at 6 am, too late for sunset.I personally did not enjoy my trip that were done later in the day.

"Paris, France",4.0,"Upon reading fellow travellers comments, we changed our plans at the last minute, and decided to go see the sunset instead of the sunrise.We were very happy we did : a security guy at the temple told us that in the morning  160+ people were there to see the sunrise. While we were around 20, and progressively 10, and only the 3 of us when the sun fully disappeared yesterday. A unique experience. Thank you tripadvisor!Now, there's a twist. A nearby hotel has a monopoly on the temple, past 5:15am. So if, like us, you want to see the full sunset, you need to buy a ""sunset tour"" ticket from the hotel. Which is not a tour actually, its merely a badge they give you, so that you don't get kicked out and can stay until 6:30pm. The pictures past 5:30 were amazing, and it was absolutely breathtaking to be at the top of the temple by ourselves when the nearby masjids started to call for prayer. As UNESCO says on its official site, it really feels like the temple is ""compromised by the lack of control of commercial activities and [...] of an adequate tourism management strategy"". You'll indeed have to shell out quite a bit for the privilege to stay until sunset. Feels like bribery to me. For this price, I would at least have expected a guide to tour us around.

"Hong Kong, China",5.0,"Enough said about the magical appeal of this temple, so I will save my breath. Instead, I will talk about how to make the most of your visit to this place. If you can afford the time and want to take it as much view and magic of the temple, opt to stay in the nearby Manohara hotel, which manages the temple, and the only place that sells sunrise and sunset tour tickets. The good thing about staying here is the reduced ticket price to the sunrise and sunset, plus free unlimited access to the temple during the time of your stay. The hotel actually has good room, service and food, so that's an added bonus. And....on top of this, the private EXIT for the hotel guests, to avoid the much dreaded miles of tourist shops, that alone is worth its weight in gold.A lot of people will opt for seeing the famous sunrise, which I am sure it's wonderful without doubt. However, 2 things, during drier month, normally it's hazy, your view to the Merapi volcano will be severely reduced. Plus there will be quite a lot of people joining this tour, so photo opportunity of the temple without anyone in view is harder to come by. Not to mention the noise reduce that magic further. Not many people will believe me, but the sunset here is even more magical! Why? Much less people (around10 or less) and really more quiet, one is able to feel alone here in this magical surroundings, take tonnes of quality photos and watch a timeless sunset, the changing of colours, with muslim prayers started around 6, this place takes in a very different aura. Ever wonder how those magazines and books take good pictures of the temple without anyone in it? This may be the answer. I have been here for 2 sunsets, both were tranquil and simply magnificent, extra money well spent.If your time is limited, find it difficult to get up early to come for the sunrise? Fear not, sun set is just as (to me, even more) magical. I'd recommend arrive here around 4pm, buy your sunset ticket from the hotel, enter the temple to start browsing around (avoid temptation of snapping photos which wastes time), come 5:15pm, everyone will be kicked out except those who has sunset ticket (namely YOU), then you can start taking photos undisturbed. The place gets pretty dark by 6:15 or 20pm, hotel will already have provided you with a torch to light your way, anyway, security guard will be around to make sure you are safely back to the hotel.Important: Avoid coming here during the rain, the climb up could be slippery, and hard to take good photos as well. Sun block is highly recommended during visit on sunny days. If you could, take one or two bottles of water, you will need it.

"London, England, United Kingdom",2.0,"This is marketed as a world-class attraction, on par with Angkor Wat in Cambodia. If it is the first major temple you will experience then you may find it worthwhile. However, for me it was not such a wonderful experience for the reasons I will outline.I visited the site from Yogjakarta and it was about 2 hour 30 minute drive. We left our hotel with a tour around 2 pm paying 60k IDR each ... it so happened there were just the 2 of us on the tour.Visiting from Yogjakarta your timing options are reliant on when the tours leave. There is a morning tour and an afternoon tour (the one we took). You can also take public bus but you may have to change a few times and this could take the major part of a day!The entrance ticket is 20 USD (students get a reduction so bring your card) and is valid till 6 pm Once inside you are in a nice park area and it is about 500m walk to the temple.The temple comprises 4 levels. The first 3 levels have very rudimentary carvings, maybe significant from a historical perspective, but certainly not matching the intricacy or detail of those in Indian temples in my opinion. However, as you are there and feel you have time till 6 pm you feel you may as well explore these levels, right?Wrong! Walking all around the first 3 levels we got to the top level (the one with the stupas which is really impressive and justifies why you went through the pain & expense of getting there!) at 5.15 pm ... and 10 minutes later we were being ushered out by the security guards! Yes, that's right, even though the ticket says 6 pm, the guards start to chase you off the top level at 5.25 pm. Why? Because they sell 'sunset experience' tickets to the more exclusive tourists at the Manohara hotel ... so regular tourists like us don't get our full alloted time!I was so disappointed! I tried to reason with the guards but they said to discuss it at the ticket counter! So for my once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see the sunset at Borobudur I am meant to be arguing with some official at the ticket office ... and by that time the sunset will have gone! So I can not say it was a positive experience and would not recommend coming all the way to Yogjakarta for this. There are better temple experiences such as Angkor Wat which has a number of more impressive sites ... and almost any temple in India will have much better carving and architecture.If you do get here (and not shelling big bucks to stay at Manohara or do there tours) .... then I recommend you get to the top level as quickly as you can and enjoy the serene view and setting for as long as the guards will allow!",2015-09-11,Friends,2014-10,united kingdom,54.7023545,-3.2765753

A ticket for both temples is USD 30 so it's definitely worth to bring along your student card, if you have it. A sarong is not necessary by the way and no tourist is wearing one. A guide is really recommended to bring along. We got one and he told some really interesting things. Others didn't and when we met them, and told them some interesting facts, they regretted their decision. One tip for all the Dutchies: You can get a Dutch speaking guide but after the tour, we were sorry we didn't go with an English speaking guide. Our guide was Japanese and spoke some Dutch, while there were other guides who spoke English fluently. So our tip of the day? Get an English speaking guide! Oh... a guide costs you around IDR 100.000 (7 EUR) so do spend your money on that. Before you start with the tour, make sure you go the toilet at the entrance first. This is your last chance!Walking around the Borobudur is lovely and really impressive. The history of it is quite fascinating. You always want to make photographs so take your time and get every angle. Also, ask other tourists to take a picture of you when traveling with friends or partner. No one minds to do that. One more thing... if you are white and especially if you are blonde, be prepared to feel like a Hollywood celebrity! For a lot of Asian visitors, this is the first time they see white people and they all want to show it to their family, back home. So expect a lot of requests for pictures. Some find this highly irritating but we didn't mind. For them, this is a once in a lifetime experience and you are doing them a huge favor by posing for a quick picture. How can you say no to that right!?",2015-09-10,Couples,2015-09,netherlands,52.2434979,5.6343227

"Brisbane, Australia",2.0,"OK, so I visited Borobudur because it has so many excellent reviews on TA. Also because I have visited many temples around the world and I usually find it an awesome experience.First thing, as I got out of my car I was mobbed by people trying to sell me hats, umbrellas and drinks, and I mean mobbed.Well, I've experienced this before, so I walk calmly to the entrance, where my Indonesian partner goes to the right and pays 50,000 IDR for a ticket to 2 temples, I go to the left and pay 375,000 IDR for the same.You walk 200 metres to the temple and begin to explore.I made the mistake of going on a sunday and it was teeming with people, this made it hard to really explore, as you really had to navigate around the masses of selfies and budding photographers. So I would recommended not going on a weekend to really be able to explore.The temple itself is beautiful, I can't deny that.Now it's time to walk back to the car. Do you think you can walk back the 200 metres you came, absolutely not. You have to walk out the exit, which is, over 1 km of aggressive markets.Its such a long walk back through markets, no other possible way out. These are aggressive markets too... People really trying to get your dollar. Not just in the stalls, but also walking up to you with cheap toys etc..And do you think the markets are selling temple related trinkets?? Not much, its mostly just cheap batik wear one after the other, with several stalls selling knuckle dusters, knives, nun chucks and other weapons... Which personally I found, irrelevant and distasteful.This is not a temple experience. This is a day out at the markets, and not good markets.I'm used to temples that are trying to cash in, but not like this. This is too bawdy, distasteful and frankly disrespectful.Personally I wouldn't bother coming here. I went to Prambanan temple on the same day, and found it much more of an experience.

Just advice, please bring your umbrella, hat and towel since the place is just like showered with the sunshine.

In today's world there are many wealthy Indonesians and just because you are Western I don't feel is a good reason for such a ridiculous difference in entry fee. 100,000 IDR is quite a valid amount to pay but this is quite over the top for entry fee. However, I must say this is an incredible site. Very magical it is very well maintained. And indonesia should always do whatever it takes to preserve this incredible wonder. I loved every minute of this visit, however, it was rather a let down when you have no choice but to travel through the kilometre maze of market stalls to exit the temple. It really makes you feel disturbed after such a spiritual calmness then your euphoric feelings are diminished by market sellers harassing you.

It is quite an awesome sight and the day we were there the crowds were not half as bad as I had expected (it was a Monday afternoon).  International visitors have to pay a much higher entry fee than domestic visitors.  There are strong arguments for and against dual pricing but I could not understand why it was only the international visitors who were obliged to wear a sarong to go around the temple?! You probably need around 60- 90 minutes to go round the temple. When you leave the temple complex you are then faced with a rat run through a line of hundreds of stalls selling souvenirs, food and all types of other goods.  There doesn't seem to be a way of avoiding this and if it's crowded you may well have to factor up to 30 minutes to work your way through the slow moving throngs.

There are a lot of inconsiderate tourists (as there are in many places of course) who don't take their photos and move on to allow the next person an opportunity for the same.

It is located 60-90 minutes from the airport hotels or from Molioboro hotels, respectively.  You should head to see this temple complex in the morning, while the crowds are thinner and the temperature is cooler.  There are two entrances here, one for Indonesians and another for foreigners.  I visited during the weekend of Indonesian Independence Day, so the temple was swarmed by local visitors.  It was nice to see locals enjoying their national heritage.  The foreign admission fee is 225,000IDR, but is half that if you bring your student ID card.  Ticket collectors did not inspect my card, which lacked a validity date, as my university no longer issues validity stickers for ID cards.  The clerk simply photocopied my student ID and I saved half the admission fee.  You get a complimentary bottle of water or cup of tea/coffee with your admission.The temple route is well marked and you can easily visit here without a guide.  If you have visited other Buddhist temples in Southeast Asia with a guide, and understand the stories behind the bas-relief and the construction techniques, go sans guide and have a freer, more enjoyable visit here.  Make sure to read the information plaque about all the hand gestures you will see on the Buddha statues at each level of this temple.  Your visit here will take about 60-90 minutes at a leisurely pace.  Enjoy the views, the bas-relief, and the stunning statues and stupas.

But when we were in the car he asked us if we wanted to see the sunrise in the hill next to the temple or in the temple, and he told us that the temple entrance was more expensive before the sunrise.Then he explained us the prices:=> Entrance to the temple before sunrise for tourists - 380.000 Rp=> Entrance to the temple after sunrise for tourists - 250.000 Rp=> Entrance to see the sunrise in the hill - 30.000 RpWe knew the entrance price was higher before sunrise, but not that high!

At the moment of paying the entrance, our driver insisted in helping us, and he bought 3 local tickets instead of the tourist tickets (that were more expensive) and he kept the difference!!

As the temple has many levels and the height is around 35 meters there are a lot of steps you need to climb before you reach the top. My advice is to take a round at each level, marvel the carvings, have some rest and then climb to next level. At the top level the Stupas are placed symmetrically around the dome resulting in a design that is both aesthetic and soothing to eyes. The panoramic views of the surrounding area from the top level are breathtaking.Visit Borobudur to appreciate ancient history and virtues of humanity that are vanishing from the modern life.",2015-08-25,Couples,2015-05,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823

We were unlucky as some clouds came in just before the sun pop out.  Nonetheless, we got some nice photos.Borobudur was very peaceful in the morning and weather was cool and comfortable.  I find the whole place very peaceful and calming even though there were many people around me.  Compared to Prambanan which we visited a day earlier, I like the peacefulness of Borobudur better.

They are very tenacious and will not let go until you buy something. If you do want to buy something, just remember that a postcard only cost 3k - 4k rupiah each.

"Zurich, Switzerland",3.0,"To keep it short: The temple is very nice. Sure Angkor Wat and Sukhotai are more impressive. However, this place has its own magic. Visit in the morning (before or at sunrise) to avoid the crowds. You need about 30min to 1 h to see the temple and all the different stone carvings and levels. To walk on the top of the temple it is a short 3min walk from the entrance. BUT - and this is the very akward point about this place - when you leave the temple, you have to make your way through never ending market stalls. I have never seen that before. It took me 30 min to get finally out and make my way out through these few hundreds of market stalls selling the same rubbish souvenirs. I can imagine that you even need more time to make your way out later in the day, when all the market stalls are open (many of them were - luckily - closed from 8.00-8.40 (which is the time I needed on my way out)). Due to these market stalls and the hazzle coming with them I cannot give a 4 point rating - so it's just a 3 point rating. The temple should get rid of (at least 90 percent) these market stalls.

"Minneapolis, MN",5.0,"This was family dream vacation.  Our son, who I in his 20s, couldn’t get over being at this facility.  It is truly awe inspiring.We stayed as the hotel directly on the premises, Hotel Manohara Borobudur, which provided us unlimited direct access to the facility.  The sunrise tour cost a bit more.  Upon arrival we went to the temple immediately in the afternoon.  I would recommend that one pace themselves and remember to bring water with.  The hotel’s view and entrance is from the main entrance.  The exit of the facility drops you directly into the local vendor’s market.  By walking along the side of the temple back to the entrance you can avoid the rather aggressive vendors, but plan on having someone walking with you trying to sell you something.For transportation we had the hotel arrange transportation from the Yogyakarta airport.  I’m sure it cost more than if I had done it myself, but the confidence that we’d arrive at the correct location was well worth the money.  Before you enter the temple area, you will be asked to wear a sarong. The management will lend it to you for free and you can give it back when you exit.The temple is amazing.  Being able to walk on every level and look at the hundreds of stone carvings is an amazing experience.  This facility is a truly unique site, unlike anything else that I’ve ever seen.  Rising from the plateau, you can just imagine the people toiling over decades to build this beautiful facility.  Walking up the steps to the top is like hiking a mountain, so you need to take your time and be careful where you step…the place is a thousand years old, so don’t expect to find anything that is flat or level.  If you bring a stroller for young children, plan on carrying it and your child.  I did not seen any place that you would be able to use a wheelchair either.  Perhaps on the first terrace, and that would have been rather rough, too.The sunrise trek is well worth the money.  If you stay at the hotel the fee is a bit less.  The photo ops are fantastic from the peak of the temple.  Expect crowds.  This is after all one of THE destination sites for both Indonesian nationals and tourists from around the world.  If there are student groups and you are Caucasian or of northern European decent (white skinned) expect the students to want to speak with you and interview you about your country.  They are very polite and will ask permission if they can speak with you.  Also, expect that you will be asked to have your picture taken with them, either one-on-one or in groups.  Indonesian families will ask to have their picture taken with you, too.  Our son had a family put a two-year old in his arms while they took pictures with him.  It was quite a surprise, but also a memory to discuss for years.  I would recommend this as a must see when traveling to Indonesia.

We went in the heat of the day and shared the experience with hordes of schoolchildren who all wanted selfies with us, which was great fun. It is in a large park with elephants too, if you have children. Two things to look out for are the ludicrous foreigner entrance fee of 20 USD - as a family of four that hurt, we don't spend 20USD on a hotel! They were unnecessarily strict about accepting our sons' student cards and made them find their university profiles on their phones - surely there is room for compassion here? And also the appalling information leaflet that is allegedly in English but isn't - if you want such information as 'when was it built?' That is nowhere provided, either in the leaflet or on the information boards anywhere on site, so do your research before coming. Now, if you have read this far this may be a reward - the hawkers in the car park were selling amazing blowpipes for just 100 rupiah which fetch 5x that on Bali, so kind of made up for the entrance fee.

"Los Altos Hills, CA",5.0,"I had limited expectations of Borobudur temple because I knew it was being rebuilt and because it's in a Muslim country which may not appreciate its significance. I was wrong. While some people visit just to go to the top and watch the sun rise or set, those who appreciate religious iconography, antiquities, and stunning works of rock carving will be transfixed by the reliefs carved into stone in this vast temple. I recommend going early to miss the crowds although as I say, most people climbed directly to the top and skipped circumambulating the four levels of stone relief, most of which tell stories of the Buddha, other historical figures, devas and Bodhisattvas. There are even carvings of Buddhist nuns sitting with the Buddha and for the 9th-centure CE, that's historic! If you visit Java, go to Borobudur.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",5.0,"The Borobudur site is simply spectacular. The conservation is on-going and is done with great care and attention to detail. A lot of work has gone into providing proper drainage for the structure to slow down water damage. This included the laying of lead sheets between layers of the building stone to reduce seepage. We were lucky that there wasnt a large crowd on our visit so we managed to walk about rather comfortably and unhurriedly. We took an official guide who was very knowlegable and he gave a good historical account of the place.Visit early in the morning as there is no shade when the sun is up. Wear a hat. Please try to avoid using an umbrella because I've seen people get poked in the eye by the spokes on umbrellas.You will be given a sarong to wear around your waist. We were informed that this wasnt a requirement becuase it was a temple, but because it was a cultural practise to wear it as a sign of repect for the site.

delhi,5.0,"Our taxi picked us up at 3.30 AM & we were going to Borobudur, the largest Buddhist monument in the world. This was such an odd time to visit some place on a holiday, but we were told that one must reach there for a stunning sunrise. This temple is often considered as one of the world’s wonders & sits on a hill top in the island of Java. We were to reach Manohara resort, about 45 kilometres from our hotel in Jogjakarta. Entry fees were around 350,000 Indonesian rupees per head. We were given a torch & were asked to follow the guide. It was pitch dark & had absolutely no idea about what was in store for us. We kept on walking & climbing never ending big stairs. With 7 kg camera equipment on my back, it was tough but cool early morning weather & expectations of getting some phenomenal shots kept me going. Reached the desired level after some very tough climbing & heaved a sigh of relief that I could manage it. As the ambrosial hour passed things started becoming visible. Whole structure was massive & an architectural marvel. Its sheer size evoked a sense of grandeur. It is an extraordinary structure with an equally amazing history. Temple covers an enormous area, overlooking the lush green rice plantation fields & was built without using any cement, mortar or glue. It is a massive interlocking stone blocks structure. This 9th century Mahayana Buddhist temple consists of nine stacked platforms (six square & three circular) topped by a central dome & is decorated with 2700 bas-relief panels & 504 Buddha statues. Little is known about the architect Gundharma, who designed it in the rein of Sailendra dynasty. Pilgrimage begins at the base of the structure & ascends to the top through three levels of Buddhist spirituality Kamadhatu (world of desire), Rupadhatu (world of forms) & Arupadhatu (Niraakaar or formlessness). Each stage is represented by a higher stage of enlightenment. Central dome is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues inside the perforated stupas. It is designed in Buddhist architecture with major influences of Indian Gupta art and indigenous Indonesian traditional art. Borobudur is simplified Javanese pronunciation of Vihara Buddha uhr a Sanskrit word meaning “the city of Buddhas”. Borobudur was constructed around the same period as the Shiva Prambanan temple, which is depicted by significant Hindu structures in the temple. It is a legacy of culture, coexisting powers & shared harmony. Buddha images, Dwarpals (Guards), lions etc all indicate the mixed Hindu & Buddhist influence. Bas-reliefs depict daily life in Java, hermits, life of Buddha, kings, queens, Apsaraas Gods, Asuras, figures of Surasundari holding a lotus, flora & fauna. Birth & life of Siddhartha is also depicted along with the mother Maya & father Suddhodana. In 14th century temple was abandoned with the decline of Hindu Kingdoms & Javanese conversion to Islam. It lay hidden for centuries under thick forest & volcanic ash. It was discovered by British ruler of Java in 1814 by Sir Thomas Stamford. Later the temple was also looted by the local officers & rulers, taking away artefacts, Buddha statues & bas-reliefs as trophies. Many artefacts can now be seen in Java museum & even in the National museum of Bangkok. Monuments also suffered damages due to soft soil around it, earthquakes & volcanic eruptions. In 1991 UNESCO declared it as world heritage site. In 1985 it was damaged by bomb attacks of Islamic terrorists. 2006 earthquake & 2010 Mount Merapi (27 kilometres from the temple) volcanic eruptions also had its sadistic effect on this beautiful structure. Temple is now well guarded because of threat by ISIS.At first all the Buddha statues look same but there are small differences in Asanas & Mudras. Many statues are headless with the heads decorating museums & private houses. As the sun rises all structures become more clear & more fascinating. Place can be very hot in the day time so it is best to visit early morning. Temple is also used as a place for pilgrimage & Buddhist in Indonesia come here every year celebrating “Vesak”. It is one of the few sites where you feel lucky that you have visited, seen & photographed it. Just like Angkor Vat & Prambanan you start feeling something special & blessed. One starts to begin to feel the extent of which we humans are capable of doing with little or no knowledge. Sunrise is stunning & most amazing. Most of the visitors were western tourist soaking in the spirituality of the place. I had a good time clicking few decent pictures.",2015-08-04,Couples,2015-07,india,22.3511148,78.6677428

Somehow this place looked cleaner than before. The tourists are also a little mor respectful, as I saw no one climbing the stupas or smoking around the temple. Only downside was the long long LONG walk out at the end where we were required to walk through HEAPS of tourist trap stalls....

Sad because you know you're getting ripped off as there is a foreigner entrance and a local entrance  *sigh*. What really did my head in though was when I was ready to go I really could not leave. I followed all the exits and I was lead through a maze of vendors selling the same crap. When I thought the horror of those vendors was over I was wrong cause then I had to walk through ANOTHER hot maze and yet ANOTHER one also. I honestly think that the people selling have put these exit signs up so you go past every single seller! I felt trapped, all I wanted to do was leave and souvenirs and souvenirs and sellers for what was im sure at least a KILOMETRE!I think I actually spent more time trying to leave than the initial time at the temple. Oh and a tip, if you have been driven there make sure you know SPECIFICALLY which part of the carpark your driver will be waiting in.

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"Getting up early is a very difficult task... Specially given than you are on holidays... But it was all worth... Getting there-Book a rental car. We started from our hotel at around 2-2:30AM. We arrived quite early, we could have started with a delay of another 30minutes and still could have made it in time. What to wear-We were told that it would like of hike and its better to get shoes but we found out that's not needed at all. You can very well go in slippers. But the stairs are a little steep and high rise so better to wear something which will have good grip. Wear comfortable clothing which won't become an issue while climbing upstairs.What to bring-Bring a hat if you want, once the sunrises, it can be really sunny n hot. If you arrive there a little early then you might wanna bring a quilt or a portable blanket to cover you up while you wait for sunrise. And don't forget to bring your camera.The view-The view of dawn (even before the sun shows up) is spellbinding. You will see vast plantation of palm tree and foggy clouds above it... until the horizon.The temple-The temple is just awesome. The symmetry is so hard to miss. There is a Buddha status in middle and when sunrays fall over it, it just looks awesome. There can be really nice clicks that you can take at that point of time. Try to go as up as you can. Its awesome. You can observe the symmetry of all the bell structures from there.The sunrise-The sunrise view of sun coming up behind the mountains is just great! It was the best sunrise. I was lucky to be on a non-cloudy day so it was quite clear view. I have been on Mount Batur trekk and would rate this one better than Mount Batur.A must go place if you are visiting Jogjakarta.

You can also bring a headlamp if you have one so that it is easier to go up with your hands free. The view from the temple complex was sublime with just the right amount of mist below while the sun slowly rises from behind the mountain. Although, as the sun goes up, more and more tourists also come.

,2.0,"We arrived at the world heritage site after an amazing 1.5 hr scooter ride from Yogyakarta. You immediately know you're there because the streets became insanely congested and vendors selling Borobudur, Joja, and power ranger dubstep apparel pop out of nowhere. We parked our scooter for 5000rp and walked into the grounds that were littered with tourists. Entrance fee was about 250,000 for an adult and 125,000 for a student (student ID required for discount). What was really amazing is that your admission granted you a single 200ml bottle of the purest room-temperature water Java has to offer. Once you get your ticket, you continue walking to the site. Then all of a sudden, there's this huge ancient monument. It looked pretty cool so we walked closer to it as, seemingly thousands of others did too. We climbed the busy stairs to the top of the monument and was severely disappointed to hear that there was no laser tag inside. Maybe it was just broken, but there was a language barrier so there was no way of knowing. Anyway, we made our way down after having several sword fights with various selfie-stick users and that's where the real fun began. Once at the bottom you enter this (I kid you not) 1km long maze of shops selling you the exact same thing. The maze was hot, cramped, and was slower than AOL dial-up.

A bit of research before you go is probably the best way so that you can peruse the temple at your own pace. Whilst it is colossal, it is not difficult to reach the top and see the spectacular views.

There are separate ticket booths for locals and foreigners, and of course prices. We paid 375,000 Rp for the combined consecutive day pass to include Prambanan. It was priced at $US30, but recently the government have legislated that all transactions have to be in Rupiah, so be advised. After you pay for your ticket you will be given a sorong to wear and a voucher for a drink and shown to a seating area.We hired a guide inside for 100,000 Rp and he showed us around for 1.5 hours. We feel this gave us a greater insight to the complex.Be warned that if you are a foreigner then there are many school children there and you will be stopped many times (plus photographed) and asked the same questions. They just wish to practice their English, but after a while it may become tiresome, as it can interfere with your exploration of the complex.

"New York City, NY",5.0,"Our trip to Indonesia centered around visiting Borobudur, so it is no surprise that we were going to enjoy the visit.  We have previously visited the marvels of Angkor Wat, so had an expectation as to what we might encounter (in terms of both the wonder, the crowds of similarly-minded tourists and the locals barraging us, following us as we walk, shoving their wares in our faces, etc.),  but I was pleasantly surprised at the relatively low crowd size and hawker/seller ratio to tourists.  The wonder of Borobudur lived up to what I had hoped to see.Some things I didn't know.  The price of regular admission is, I believe, around $5 per person.  The price for a pre-admission sunrise tour or a post-closing sunset tour is much higher (about $30 per person) but it is well worth it.  The ""tour"" for the sunrise and sunset sessions at this price is unguided, however they do provide a flashlight and (once the flashlight is returned) a souvenir batik scarf.  Not knowing about the unguided tour option, we started our visit to Borobudur with a guided tour by a very knowledgeable english-speaking guide named Heru that costed approximately $55 per person, including admission to the park, the flashlight and souvenir.Having hindsight, while relatively expensive, I'm not sure what I would have done differently.  Yes, Borobudur can be experienced without the guided tour but we learned a lot about the numerous reliefs, the meaning of each level of Borobudur, the construction and refurbishment efforts of Borobudur and great tips on the best photo opportunities.  The sunrise unguided tour was also special, as we had the place virtually to ourselves.  Unfortunately, the sun was behind clouds but the opportunity to be on this magnificent structure with, perhaps, 10 other people for an extra hour was worth it.  No worries about taking photos and trying to find a way to not have other people (that you don't know) in the photo!The sunrise tour was well attended (200-300 people) and had magnificent views.  A perfect way to start the day.  The sunset tour did not have the same views but had approximately 10 people in total on location.

,4.0,"I have been hearing about Borobudur Temple which hold the Guinness World record holder as the largest Temple (i hope I am correct).  So I was excited to see it personally during this vista to Jogjakarta, Indonesia.  We were supposed to depart from our hotel at 4 in the morning.  Our guide tell us that there is place where you can see Borobudur Temple as the sun rises.  Unfortunately our ride did not report on time.  So our guide called for another ride.  We arrive Borobudur temple at around 7 in the morning.  There were already a lot of people queuing in line to visit the temple.  After paying the entrance fee we were ushered to a place where we were given a piece of cloth (i forgot the local name) to wear it on our waistline.  This is to pay respect to the temple since this is s place of worship.  Our guide hired a local historian to accompany us and at the same time tell the history of the place.  The local historian explain first, in front if a map, the different parts of the temple.  He also showed us where to take pictures where the temple have a great vantage point.  Then he start by explaining the level by level history of the temple, even the areas where the temple was deliberately covered by set of stones (care of UNICEF) in order to gain or take hold so that the temple will not collapse.  The sculpture in the stone were full of stories that we never noticed the grandioseness of the temple.  In short we fully understood (we hope so) what more or less the temple was built.       After the guided tour we were briefly ushered to a last final place to have a photo opportunity.  And there we see the amazing view of the Borobudur Temple.  Although the temperature was so hot and humid, the visit was very satisfying.  Upon going out there were lots of vendors selling souvenir items.  As a tip, do the bargain by half.  At first the vendor won't budge.  But after a while and after a series of bargaining from other vendors, they will give it to you.  There are lots of souvenir items to chose from.  I suggest to buy it here before leaving Jogjakarta and Indonesia.  Overall, if you are a nature and history lover,  I suggest never to miss visiting Borobudur Temple.",2015-07-03,Business,2015-05,,,

It is stupefying to imagine how much the architects had to toil to give shape to this monument.. that too at a period (1200 years back approx) when technologies were not much advanced. There are various levels on the temple. Fantastic view from the highest level where the stupa is. Very steep stone steps as is common with buildings of those times. Be careful to avoid leg muscle cramps later on. As the kingdoms were set up by Buddhist / Hindu kings from India, it is reflected in the temple carvings/reliefs  which are similar to Indian temples such as the stone Shardula and Makara statues on each level / relics from Ramayana or Jataka tales (birth of Buddha). However, the architecture of the temple (giant bells with a Buddha statue inside) stands out. Make sure you have enough drinking water with you particularly if it is a sunny day.

Once the masses were allowed in at 6am it got significantly busier but initially only on the lower levels. Be aware as a westerner a lot of school kids will want a picture and the most well known English word appears to be 'selfie'!

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"Read the wiki for fascinating historical info about this place. If you're a tourist then you need to know the following:Their are lots of ways to get to Borobudur from Yogyakarta. I used a Tour agents to book a driver without a guide. The driver took us to the entrance and met us at the Indonesian craft gauntlet's exit. Round trip, including an hour walking around the temple taking tons of pictures,  took us 3.5 hours, just under the 4 hour limit for the tour package.  Unless you're a devout Buddhist, don't even try to go on June 1st & 2nd because those two days are Vesak day (Buddha's birthday) in Indonesia and the temple and surroundings will be mobbed with people. Go on the 3rd like we did and breeze through the place. You need a ticket to get in and there are two ticket counters. If you're Indonesian, good news your tickets are cheaper than if you're a foreigner, just go to the counter on the right. Bad news is your ticket counter is outside and you don't get a free drink or have access to a clean bathroom.  As a foreigner you have to buy your ticket at the air conditioned building on the left. Once you've paid, choose a ticket for either  a free soft drink, a bottle of Aqua, or a cup of coffee or tea. Then help yourself to the clean restrooms before you head out to the temple grounds. From this point forward there will be lots more opportunities for you to spend your money needlessly, for example, on the train, for a sarong, or in the craft gauntlet at the exit. Don't panic...you actually don't need to buy or rent anything else to visit and enjoy the temple, just keep following the signs towards ""Candi Borobudur.""We arrived at the temple around 11am and I was glad I had a wide brimmed hat and had applied sun screen on my bare arms.The temple looks huge from the ground but it gets smaller as you ascend so only the first level takes a while to walk around, the rest are quite quick. There are so many beautiful carvings that it is tempting to photograph them all so bring lots of memory cards & batteries for the camera, or a charger for your phone. When exiting you will be channeled to what they call the ""museum."" This is a euphemism for what can only be called a ""craft gauntlet,"" with people trying to sell you more junk than you can imagine. Just smile and tell them, ""later,"" which seems to be the friendly way to say,  ""no thanks."" I could not find any shortcut back to the car park so we just walked through the whole thing until at last we saw the exit and our waiting driver. If you absolutely must have something, remember to haggle. I find starting at 25% of the original asking price a good place to start. After some good-spirited banter back and forth with the seller this usually results in a 50% discount from the final price.

For the visit to Borobudur Temple, the earlier you go, the better it is. The place was getting crowded with people towards noon and you can't get a clear picture of the structure because somehow someone will happen to photobomb your picture.

Once you get off the car at the parking area, before u enter the temple, you will be surrounded with people who sells hat, sunglasses and souvenirs. If you are not good in bargaining, don't get anything from them, because the price is much higher and also don't tell the seller that you will come back later to buy if you don't want.

We entered through Manohara hotel and they provided a torch light and a map for us. I would advise to take the Sunrise tour instead of normal tour as it is very crowded after 6:00 am.

It is a journey; the swirling circles rise upwards to take you from the world of earthly desires to the abstract space where desires cease.

I understand from a local this was the reason why UNESCO withdrew from supporting the place as a heritage site (although this needs to be verified). For such an ancient site, I was disappointed that they did not control the numbers better - probably because the control gate at the entrance was conveniently not working. Visitors are being constantly harassed by street vendors, even in the temple grounds. I do have mixed feelings on this - as a visitor, it spoils my experience but at the same time I am sympathetic that for a lot of the people who live there, it is a means for a living.If you are into temple ruins then go straight to Siem Reap to visit Angkor Wat.

Climbing this wonderful monument is a feat not for the mobility impaired, its steep and 170 steps are rugged, but does have hand rails, which are not so secure at times.  The views from the top of the temple are magnificent, and the carvings are lovely. Supported by UNESCO its a restoration in progress.  Be aware the hawkers are quite pushy.If visiting Java visiting this temple should be on top of your list should be a must.

"Penang Island, Malaysia",4.0,"Before we booked our journey to Yogyakarta and subsequently visited the BOROBUDUR we had extensive email contact with the BOROBUDUR Management office. We explained that one of us needed a wheelchair, asked if one was available, could we use it and most importantly were grounds around the BOROBUDUR  WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE. We received a YES on all questions. Management of BOROBUDUR asked us our arrival date in order to be fully prepared; Management of BOROBUDUR and staff looked forward to our visit. We asked our hotel to make all the arrangements and they kindly did.The BOROBUDUR itself is utterly amazing, grounds are immaculately kept and that’s where it stops! Arriving one feels as if a cloud of locus’s have descended upon you. Umbrella’s, hats, postcards and other stuff you most certainly do not want to possess are just about rammed thru your throat! Nobody in the office (kantoor) knew of our arrangement, we were shoved from pillar to post and only when I showed the BOROBUDUR staff the email letters exchanged by us and the BOROBUDUR Management office someone vaguely remembered something! We got a wheelchair, were told that we had to pay for it though one look from me and that was quickly annulled! Grounds of the BOROBUDUR ARE IN NO WAY WHEELCHAIR accessible! If you have a child in a stroller I would seriously rethink the whole BOROBUDUR ADVENTURE! We barely managed simply by letting my husband walk behind the wheelchair whilst I surveyed the grounds. Thank God I saw in the distance a little train! At the ticket office we soon found out that the sales lady had no interest in selling tickets to us nor was she interested in explaining why, her mobile beckoned. It was the postcard/hat/umbrella sellers who took pity and helped us in the train. It turned out that the steep entranced fee also covered the train ride! Sitting comfy we enjoyed the absolutely stunning landscape. BOROBUDUR grounds are extremely well maintained however we could not understand why there were not more litter bins nor any facilities for toilets! Amidst beautiful scenery, with no BOROBUDUR in sight, the train abruptly stops and all passengers have to get out. BOROBUDUR itself is stunning to say the least though one need to spend at least a week to fully understand and see the monument! Getting a ride back in this little train is a problem. Nobody knows when it arrives at the place where it spits out its passengers, nobody knows how often it runs and there is no time table! We were stuck as we were not allowed to take the wheelchair – which was useless anyway – into the little train. We managed to walk to a few dwellings. In front of one stood an ambulance. Running out of options I went inside and explained that my physically challenged husband needed to go back to the entrance. A kind lady and a kind gentleman, obviously manning the ambulance post, made no bones about it and offered us ride in their ambulance, no not lying down on a stretcher but in the front seat. They would not take any money, did want any coffee etc and were only too happy to accommodate us. Those two people were they only BOROBUDUR staff who reached out and understood what true hospitality means!Would we recommend seeing the BORORBODUR, yes, most definitely yes however note and remember (!) that looking at this amazing sight is not for the faint-hearted, not really a thing for young children and most definitely NOT FOR the physically challenged and make double sure that you've had your pee at the beginning ‘cos you’ll be in trouble if you have not ☺ I would like to mention that last year, whilst in Bali we went to a park outside Denpasar where a mini replica of the BOROBUDUR was build. Here you could at ease look at the intricate way of building. Not only that, there they did have a golf cart where the physically challenged could be transported. Their staff was fully capable and willing to make their guest as comfortable as possible something the Yogyakarta BOROBUDUR most certainly did not. The Yogyakarta BOROBUDUR gave us and many others the distinct feeling that it was all about money which is very very sad!",2015-04-30,Couples,2015-04,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823

Almost everyone was the general tourist, not the Budha pilgrim.The main enterance area where you buy the ticket is clean and tidy. The information center is located in the left side just after you passed the main enterance. If you want to know more about Borobudur, it is a good idea for you to spent couple of minutes in that place. They also provide a guide for you if you ask one.The management also provide train-a-like vehicle for you to go to the temple area (which is quite far). This is very helpful so you can save your energy to climb the temple later on. Unfortunately, it is not available when you go back to the enterence area.For those who traveling with young children, please DO NOT bring your stroller to the temple area since there is no disabled passage (only stairs available). You can easily put it into the deposit counter which is located in the vicinity of enterence area.Before you enter the temple area, you will be asked to wear a sarong. The management will lend it to you for free and you can give it back when you exit the area.The Borobudur temple itself is so majestic. You cannot get enough to take pictures of it. To climb the temple is challenging but afterward you will be given your reward (of nice views).To exit temple area is the worst thing to do there since so many vendors selling their merchandise while blocking your way.

It was made famous by the great Raffles who is also a great part of Singapore and Malaysia history. This adventure is made expensive by our safety decision to fly instead of staying near Borubudur. There is an Aman group of hotel near the temple so if you wish to stay there its also a nice alternative. We loved the beach of Bali so we spent about 2 thousand dollars for the air plane and guide who even stole our umbrella at the airport.  Anyway , Borubudur is majestic and you need a healthy heart to finish the complex. The highlight is the stairway to heaven representing the levels to Nirvana/ enlightenment/Buddhist heaven. One can find the tree of Buddha and his complete life story carved on the walls just like Ankor Wat . The best pictures are from the top hence the need for a healthy tourist. It's worth it for a sites junkee and more so the spiritual ,historical junkee. Bring extra money for there is a separate guide in the complex. Souvenirs are cheap so take advantage.

You can buy a package ticket for US$30 (only available in Borobudur and the ticket office only receive rupees, you can exchange your note next to the counter) for Prambanan and Borobudur within two days. Bear in mind if you go to Prambanan the following day, you must clearly inform the ticket officer not to stamp at the back, otherwise you must visit both attractions within one day. Don't forget to enjoy your free drink (coffee, tea or mineral water) at the entrance because she charge you higher admission fee than locals. If possible, don't visit the temple on  Saturday , Sunday as well as public holiday, because you may be surrounded by overcrowded school kids attempting to practice their English. Besides, there is also a sunrise tour organized by the hotel inside the Borobudur with a free breakfast provided. In order to avoid the flood of tourists, it is ideal for you to visit the temple in the early morning. The pagoda is divided into the base (Kamadhatu), five square terraces ( means earth, Rupadhatu) and  topped by three circular ones (means heaven, Arupadhatu).  432 Buddha images sit in chambers on the terrace, then 72 Buddha images on the upper circular one, but the essence must be the big pagoda at the top. You must spare more time in watching those reliefs on each terrace, of course climbing to the top is not too difficult. The security guards on the upper circular terrace are very helpful to answer your inquires in details, even willing to take photos for you upon request. Enjoy the fresh air and not in a rush.

The temple it self is awesome and on par with Angkor Wat and the ancient Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka and Thailand. The stone work and is amazing and at sunrise the mist clears to open up the majestic volcano Mount Merpi in the distance - superb photo ops for the camera happy.

"Bromma, Sweden",4.0,"This is truly a masterpiece! I was very impressed with the temple and they've done a great job restoring and preserving it while still keeping that magical ancient look of it. Tip 1. It's more expensive, but probably worth it to book a sun rise tour. Much less people if you do that. We didn't and ended up fighting our way around the temple to get that one good picture with no one in it. Tip 2. If you're not bothered about people or sun rise, don't bother to book a tour. Take the bus from yogyakarta to Borobudur (1 hour journey from the north bus terminal, pay no more than 15.000. They will ask for 20-25.000 but don't pay that.)Tip 3. Bring an umbrella ;) As a foreign tourist you'll have to pay 250.000 to get in. Coffee, tea or water included... Yay... Indonesians pay 30.000. Reasons for giving it four and not five in rating: - The unfair pricing- They need more security. Visitors do not respect that climbing is not allowed and that will ware the temple down quicker than we can imagine if it continues. - they have loud speakers all around the area where they all of a sudden start to broadcast a message now and then.

It is absolutely worth it to hire a local tour guide who can help explain not only the history of the area but also explain some of the stories that have been etched on the stones. This large temple is absolutely beautiful and the top most level with the big stupas and some open stupas are brilliant. The view from up top, not only of Merapi Mountain but also of the surrounding area is superb. There is a lot of climbing involved so the elderly and young children need to be careful when visiting. We did not do the sunrise or sunset tour but that in no way took away from the wondrous site. There is a large park around the temple and a train that goes around it so any elderly folk who cannot manage the climb can still view the structure from the outside.Several vendors in the area who are very persistent and follow you around insisting you buy something.

"Mold, United Kingdom",5.0,"This is not the easiest temple to get to unless you are staying in one of the hotels nearby. We visited from Semarang which is at least two hours away. The cruise ship tours are expensive but the convoy of buses with have a police escort which is an experience in itself especially if you are in Bus number one (the time will fly and the scenery is interesting too). Without the escort, which gets you through traffic on the wrong side of the road and through red lights, it might take twice the time. Organising this independently is difficult and if you pay for a private police escort the cost will be quite high. The temple itself is magnificent and well worth the visitand even when our party of about 200 people arrived it was not busy and frequented by local touists who loved to have their photos taken with you. Their bright clothing helped brighten up the rather dark colours of the temple. There are a few men with parasols and fans who will follow ladies around and shade them.

You can book very easily a driver to get you there as every visitor to Yogyakarta does this tour. They will drop you at the parking of Borobudur Park, where you will pass through some lodgings and a nice cafe before reaching the temple. When we arrived we had a quick coffee while there were many people praying. As the morning was coming closer we climbed to the top of the temple. I strongly recommend a flash-light. Once you are the top, you will start feeling the vibes of the place.  When we went it was at the end of the rainy season, so we didn't get to see the sun in full but still we were surrounded by a wonderful dark blue colour and mist, which made it feel really mystical!So even if you happen to be in one of those cloudy days, do not stress out as it will still be stunning! After we took as many pictures as we could, we started gradually climbing down and only then we started realising how incredible was the whole structure. If you take your time it might take up to an hour to walk around each level but you will be rewarded with incredible statues and stonework.

Semarang,4.0,"Borobudur temple is my favourite temple in Indonesia, but I always have mixed feeling about taking visitors there.  The carvings and statues are so beautiful and serene, and the scenery exquisite, but if you go at the wrong time you may not be able to appreciate them fully.  Last time I took my daughter, a New Zealand teenager, we were swamped by school groups wanting to take her photo, to the extent that she could not move for some time because of the groups queuing around her. In the end I had to be a little blunt and ask people to leave her alone so she could walk through the temple, but by then she was feeling claustrophobic and tense - exactly the opposite kind of feeling the builders of this temple were trying to promote. Next time we will try the morning sunrise tour with a tour guide - it is a lot more expensive than just entering on your own, but a guide will help us keep away the school groups. Another word of warning - there are a lot of hawkers on your way out of the temples, and many stalls selling souvenirs.  As with any such tourist site, you'll need to bargain if you want a good price. They are all selling similar things, so don't buy from the first person who approaches you, get a feel for the prices first.

This is the only free entry into the grounds for the entire year.More interesting would be the preparation of the ceremonial troupe that was leading the entire match.

For foreigners, we are provided with sarong & free bottled water but do bring a hat , shades and wear sunblock plus I have these cute mosquito repellent stickers that I brought with me, I got one and placed it just below the edge of my shirt. - coming from SEA country myself & it certainly worked when I went to Angkor Wat.some students would ask to take pictures with you too, I was told that it's their 'project' in school called 'meeting with foreigners' - I'm not sure of their project's exact name though but it's kinda fun taking pictures with them plus - credit to the students, they make it fast! me and my friend spent almost 3-4 hrs as we savored each view all the way from the bottom to the top then looking at Mt.

Singapore,5.0,"Java has been a seat of wisdom and learning from centuries. Yogyakarta/Jogja in central Java is famous for its Buddhist and Hindu temples from 6-9th century. Borobodur  is a medieval Buddhist temple restored in 19th century as a result of effort by Sir Stamford Raffles (founder of Singapore). It's a UNESCO world heritage site and considered by many as the 8th manmade wonder of the world.The temple complex is located in centre of a park and stairways lead you to the top of the temple. There are stupas in the temple complex. The stairs are known as a stairways to heaven/salvation. The stairs require you to tell big steps as the path to heaven is not easy. The stairway is divided into 3 parts, symbolizing 3 stages of enlightenment and finally Nirvana. The stages are Desires, Form and Formlessness and finally the giant stupa of Nirvana.The top layer is full of calm faced Buddha statues in lotus meditation pose. The statues are inside inverted bell shaped stones in a grid pattern. The summit consists of a giant non transparent stupa.The temple is annotated with stories teaching good conduct. One corner of the temple on 1st stage is seemingly covered up with stones. The guide informed us that it's possibly due to indecent sculpture in that portion. Each small detail in the temple has a spiritual / philosophical meaning attached to it, which will not be clear to you unless you are an ardent student or you are with a good guide. I have been to Jogja twice and both times was unimpressed with Borobodur guide. Prembanan guide on the other hand was great at explaining the temple as well as underlying philosophy. There are separate tickets for locals and foreigners and foreigners are greeted with cold water and free sarong. Guides are optional, licensed and carry a fixed charge-tip is optional.Tips:- Look for a good guide reviews for Borobodur if you are a history and culture enthusiast.- Don't climb over the stupas- Don't  be disrespectful to the stupas eg. By touching them with feel/footware.",2015-01-29,,,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992
"El Sobrante, CA",5.0,"We took a day trip from Bali. Leave Bali 7:05 am and return on 6:40 pm.  There is 1 hour time difference so you get to Yogjakarta 7:20 am. The air fare costs 150 US by Garuda Airlines.(roundtrip per person) If you want to much cheaper one go look for Air Asia or Lion Air.  Attention travelers, the old Airport, International and Domestic terminals are side by side. However, new Airport, Domestic terminal is a mile apart from International one. so you need to tell the taxi driver ""Airport Domestic Terminal'.  Upon arriving Yogjakarta, you need to hire a taxi. They can go around 500000Rp(US$40) for 1 day. About 1 hour drive to get there. Surprisingly enough just an end of residential area, there are a parking lot for the temple. Now you need to pay an entrance fee 250000Rp per person(US$ 20) , tourist price to maintain the world heritage. Walk thru a few minutes, and still we didn't see anything, then all of a sudden , the temple on our right. Good work. About 8 story building, there are steps to go up, narrow and high, so take your time. The central steps are always crowded, there are 3 other steps on each direction , so if you need an extra time use less crowded one. Must to bring sunblock, a hat and a bottle of water. There was not much shades and no room for an umbrella.  A top view was a heart warming. You can see everything in 1 hour, allow some extra time for a shopping on the way out.

"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",3.0,"Do not fall into any tour operator or package. The most common and most expensive is the sunrise at Borobudur Temple. From others' observations, I have been told that there was nothing very special about spending sunrise time over there. In fact, people say it was very crowded. The beauty of photo shooting there is when there are no people in the background.For me, I rented a scooter with a friend from the hostel at 11 a.m. from a nearby shop. We negotiated the price till we got the best one. We drove alone to the temple which was relatively far away from the center of Yogyakarta (Jogjakarta), however, the trip gave us a better look into the city, daily life, districts, people and traffic. We also stopped few times for some cold, cheap, fresh and delicious mango juice :)When we arrived, we had to park our motorbike somewhere close to the entrance. We had to pay some money for the parking lot, but then the parking guard -sort of- looked after and watched our motorbike which made us feel comfortable about the rented motorbike and our helmets.At the entrance, you may get a discount if you have a valid university card. People at service are very nice and decent. They serve you water or tea for free with the entrance ticket. There is no need to take a tour guide. If interested, you may read about the temple on the Internet beforehand or visit a museum adjacent to the temple which tells the history of excavation.Most probably, the locals visiting the temple will ask for a photo with you if you're not Asian. They are very kind and humble but you may be stuck for few minutes taking photos especially if there is a school tour.After you leave the temple, there are hundreds of souvenir shops and cafes so you may spend some time there but sellers are so nagging to sell you anything. It is also quite sad as the sellers are very poor so if you are willing to spend some cash for things you don't need, then please do and consider it charity!",2015-01-29,Friends,2014-10,united arab emirates,24.0002488,53.9994829

"Luzon, Philippines",4.0,"This review is quite late.  I was in grade school when I first saw photos of the Borobudur Temple and since then I was dreaming of personally seeing the grandeur of this colossal structure some day. Finally, one day I found a ridiculously low fare to Yogyakarta in the Air Asia website so I thought of just grabbing the deal. Combining this trip with Bali was a brilliant idea since the airfare back to Singapore was at the tune of US$25 only, thanks to Air Asia for the bargain!I opted for the sunrise tour with a private driver since I also have to rush to the Prambanan Temples before my flight to Denpasar late in the afternoon. After paying the entrance fee I walked all the way to the temple along with other visitors, mostly locals. Too bad there was a restoration work going on; some areas at the top of the temple were inaccessible. While taking some photos,  a couple of young students approached me to pause with them. I was puzzled because back home this experience is exclusively for showbiz celebrities and no one would care to invite an ordinary person like me for a photoshoot. Even in my wildest dream I never thought that being a foreigner will turn me into an instant celebrity in Java. Tips: 1) Visit the temple before sunrise since it could become too hot during the day;  2) wear comfortable footwear/rubber shoes since you have a lot of walking to do, and 3) bring a camera with wide angle lens and sweeping panorama feature to capture great images.",2015-01-21,Solo,2014-02,philippines,12.7503486,122.7312101

"San Francisco, CA",4.0,"We decided to see these places in under 2 days; we transited from Jakarta and arrived in Yogyakarta at 7am; Mr. Wiedy's driver/guide was waiting for us and took us first to Prambanan temple which is very close to the airport.  We spent a few hours there getting a guided tour (included); in retrospect, we should have taken the bikes and ridden around to the other temples too that are within the same grounds.  We then went to the the Kraton palace (underwhelming) and had a nice woman walk us around (unnecessary to have a guide here IMO) and then we drove to Borobudur, stopping for lunch near the end at an Indonesian restaurant off the main road. We checked into the Manohara hotel (I booked this separately and saved about $20) which is very nice; it started raining and it got dark by 6pm so we didn't do anything that night (in retrospect, this could have been a good night for a Ramayana show if we had based ourselves in Yogya); the next morning we went for the sunrise tour (which is not really a tour, it's just the ability to enter before others); at the top it was nice and the sun coming up was lovely with Mt. Merapi, but there were a lot of other people there all taking photos (I know, what did I expect?); we met our excellent guide (included in the tour costs), Mr. Fatah, who gave us a lot of history and information about the temple; we saw the boat museum and on the way back to Yogya saw the other two temples (the Mendut temple was enjoyed more after having seen the movie at Manohara). We missed Taman Sari (closed) and had some lunch and were dropped back at the airport around 1600 (flight was of course delayed due to weather for many hours).  Overall, our guide/driver was really nice and helpful; the guides at Prambanan and Borobudur were very good; transfers were made really easy; I felt the price was a bit steep ($145pp) but in retrospect, we paid $40 often for a 2h taxi going from place to place and add in the entry fees to the temples, and palace (probably $40pp), etc., you could do it cheaper, but with limited time, it was worth it.

Borobudur does not awe you with its grandness as many superstructures do, Taj Mahal, for instance, is one such architectural wonder. In reality Borobudur is not built to amaze at all, since what it embodies are the virtues of peace, ahimsa (non-violence) and Wisdom. The reliefs on the walls are eloquent with the stories of Jataka, the different reincarnations of Lord Buddha.This place reminds one of the greatness of a truly remarkable religion and the relevance of its tenets to the modern times. The Indonesian Government and UNESCO have done a great job restoring the site. We went early in the morning on a Sunday, before the crowds started pouring in. We were stopped from time to time by school students on educational tours with requests for group photographs. It was lovely seeing the groups erupt in joy each time we obliged.

Why? because 30 minutes later, people will start pouring in from every angel and you will not be able to soak in the magic of this place by yourself or take pictures without someone's head peeking in.5. buy the combined temple ticket for borobudur and prambanan . for the 2 of us it cost 720000 for both places together.6.

"Washington DC, DC",5.0,"Set away from the busy cities of Java, this temple is a site to behold. Amazing Buddhist relic you need to see in person. This is a huge tourist attraction though, so keep that in mind as there are guaranteed to be swarms of tourists at the temple site. Sarongs are provided at ticket center. It's decent walk to get to the temple and be aware that the steps up the temple are steep and uneven. There is no wheelchair access of any kind to climb the temple. Watch your step and take your time climbing. The volume of people racing up and down to take photos can easily lead to someone falling. However, once on top of the temple there are some amazing pictures to be had. A truly unique piece of world history.If bringing small kids, leave your stroller behind. Simply said, don't bring it. There's no feasible way to carry it up the temple steps. Backpack carrier would be fine. However, keep small kids close if they're walking as the steps are high and once on the upper levels you'll notice in some areas there is nothing preventing someone from simply walking off the temple. Not the place for kids to be running around, dangerous absence of railings in many spots can lead to a bad day. Great pictures to be had around this site, including on the walk to the temple itself. Serious downside though, upon exiting the temple grounds you're forced to walk thru can only be described as a gauntlet of vendors and small shops all the way to the exit/parking lot. The path seems to never end and is not the high point of the tour. The distance of this path is probably close to 1 mile. Nothing but vendors one both sides the whole way down the path. You'll see this firsthand when trying to leave. If you do decide to buy something, have smaller bills and be ready to haggle for a better price. Also, expect that after you buy something or show any money to have other vendors approach you as well. Enjoy the tour, and don't let this sour your experience.If bringing small kids, sunscreen, water/juice, and a hat are good ideas. It can get quite warm when climbing the temple, so hydrate early and often.

It's one of UNESCO's World Heritage Site and has managed to survive many natural disasters, from earthquakes to volcanic eruptions, though there are damaged ruins.Principally, what makes it more exciting for me to visit was the overwhelming history contained within the mount of rocks. However, the entire experience was very disappointing for one stupid reason: the local crowds.Now I get that visiting the temple is probably something everyone wants to share with the world, but is it really necessary to take pictures for like every one step of the way? And don't even get me started with the negligence of the guards. They're standing around making friends with visitors who are violating rules clearly stated on signs everywhere:1. Do Not Smoke in the Temple Area2. Do Not Sit on the Relics3. Do Not Climb the Relics4. Do Not LitterAs far as my eyes could see, children and adults were sitting around like they're on the beach taking silly selfies; making a big crowd at certain areas that it gets so hard to move and observe around the temple conveniently. It was so disrespectful and the worst part is that the guards didn't seem to be bothered by these many violations at all. It didn't necessarily ruin the visit for me, but it did ruin the experience as a whole. (An example of this can be seen on the picture I attached to this review).I'm so embarrassed as well because I saw a lot of foreign visitors (heard some of them speaking Malay, Spanish, French, and English) and I saw none of them doing what the locals were doing (sitting, climbing, smoking, littering like it's their god-forsaken private space).

Four of us in my family party hired a local driver and vehicle for the two way trip - effectively for the day - for U$100. The drive itself was an experience, both scenically and to see as a passenger the devil may care insouciance displayed by Indonesian drivers in general. The road toll in Java is very high, but speeds are generally low, and the myriad motor cyclists are the unfortunate major casualty group.Borobudur is now cleaned up  after a 2012 volcanic eruption deposited a thick ash layer over the monument, thanks to 18 months of labour by a 700 strong volunteer workforce. A considerable preceding renovation effort had taken place over years; for after the stupa had been ""discovered"" by Raffles in 1904, the essentially unprotected statuary was pillaged by antiquarians and treasure hunters, both Europeans and others. These depradations are continuing to be made good, and the stupa is on such a scale and essentially so whole that these blemishes do not detract from the experience. The Indonesian Government has taken the site in hand, keeping an enormous army of touts and hawkers at a distance and out of the well-maintained surrounding grounds. The entrance fee was about U$20 each. We hired a guide for U$15 and that was very worthwhile - our guide was a Muslim woman, a former teacher, who gave a wonderfully clear outline of the Buddhist beliefs and teachings of the original builders, and the significance of the layout and principal statues in their practices.

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"Mind blowing visit. Imagine a structure built this monumental without any cement, nuts and bolts and lasting up till now. How was it even possible? Goes to show how sophisticated the artisans and the builders were thousands of years ago! A must visit if you travel to Jogja. Go with the official guide if you want an informative tour. Guides can speak basic English but don't stress them too much with your incessant questions. Keep the questions simple and be patient. You pay a small sum (not more than IDR250k) at the counter for the official guide. Even then, do give them a tip at the end of the tour for their trouble and effort. Didn't get a chance to wear the sarong during the visit because it was drizzling when we arrive that morning. Glad that the rain stopped as we climbed the candi. View from the candi was spectacular. Overall experience was amazing. Just be prepared to go through a swarm of pushy souvenir sellers as you exit and move towards your vehicle. If you really wish to purchase anything, do so when you are already in the vehicle because price goes down significantly. If you stop before reaching your vehicle to take a look at the goods they are selling, be prepared to experience claustrophobia as the pushy sellers swarm all around you. I had no unpleasant experience of being pickpocketed anywhere in Jogja, so far. Sellers though pushy, were polite. If you don't wish to buy anything, just stay polite but firm when telling them you are not buying. You may want to practise saying, ""Tidak mahu beli, terima kasih Book"" (or ""Park"", if the seller is a male). If you have bought something and realized that you could have bought it cheaper elsewhere, just smile and tell yourself that at least you are helping the locals to be entrepreneurial and independent. Better this than leading a life of crime in order to survive. :) But if you don't want to be taken for a ride, do your homework first or ask around before going to similar places.",2014-12-03,,,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992
"Atlanta, GA",5.0,"The comparison is not that stupid: both are built on a massive scale and the Borobudur temple is built as a step-pyramid.

"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",5.0,Borobudur temple is a Buddhist temple about two hours drive from Indonesia. The first thing that strikes you when you first set eyes on the temple is that it is built much like a pyramid. Of course the illusion goes away as you get closer to the temple.The temple has seven layers. Each layer depicts a phase in Buddhist philosophy with the higher layers reflecting detachment from the world and material possessions. There is a corridor around each layer where the devout can walk around. The inside walls of each corridor are covered with scenes from the life of Lord Buddha and there are images of lord buddha in his various poses at regular intervals.The top of the pyramid has a massive solid dome surrounded by many hollow domes containing buddhist idols.Essentially an entire hill has been covered in stone and carved with buddhist reliefs. To have done this over a thousand years ago was a major achievement.Guides are easily available near the attraction for a reasonable fee and there are many souvenir shops around the temple.Definitely worth a visit purely for its architectural merit and scale.,2014-11-29,Solo,2013-12,saudi arabia,25.6242618,42.3528328

lfegana,5.0,"Borobudur (UNESCO World Heritage site), built in the 9th century, is considered the largest Buddhist temple in the world, and is used for pilgrimage; once a year.  The huge number of Buddha statues (though most with severed and stolen heads) and largest number of bas reliefs of any Buddhist temple in existence (2,670), make it a photographers dream.  I think this is a fantastic visit, which should not be hurried. For visitors, like my wife and I, who came from very far, the only negative criticism I would have is certainly not with the temple, but with the set (standard?) tours, which take you from Yogyakarta to Borobudur for a visit of just a few hours.  Our guide appeared very knowledgeable but, because of the lack of time, could not afford to spend enough of it on each of the reliefs that to this day have been understood (many are still being studied to decipher their meanings).  These reliefs depict not only the life Prince Siddhartha, who would later become the Buddha, but teach moral, good manners, family and aesthetic values, as well as illustrating how life was at that time (different ethnicities, dressing customs, work, hobbies, etc).  There is too much to be said about this spectacular temple, and this may not be the place to add much detail, as there are countless sites that may hell the future visitor, but I will tell you that you will not be sorry if you plan to go there and do not limit your visit to a few hours, but to at least a couple of days.  Also, go with an open mind and insist on being assigned the most expert guide possible who will help you immersed yourself in this incredible culture and time through the proper interpretation of the bas reliefs and the correct clockwise Bodhisattva walk to the top towards enlightenment",2014-11-20,Couples,2014-11,venezuela,8.0018709,-66.1109318

"Heidelberg, Germany",3.0,"pros:the temple itself is huge. a must-see, really. if you have been in the temples at bali earlier youll notice the difference... no wonder this is an unesco world heritagethere is some sort of rail-less train (i didnt go for a ride), a cinema with a documentary about the temple and a museum inside the temple areaa sarong is provided w/o extra fees (yet, there are advantages in bringing your own one - read on below)cons:the prices - you have to pay a far huger amount of RP (350k RP / 30$)  compared to the locals. well - keeping in mind, that you also earn far more compared to the salary of an indonesian, you COULD call that fair. (but on the other hand... compared to the balinese temples whose entry fees are just a fraction of this one... or completely free..well)if you dont bring your own sarong, you might get to leave earlier than you intend to (you miss the sunset) - (read on below)also, there may be signs that you ""shouldnt climb there"" or ""arent allowed to touch that"" - but seriously? no one cares - including the security guards. i guess on an islamic island, taking care of buddhist or hindu temples isnt that ""important"" than on bali. quite a shame.. though at the time we visited the temple the northeastern upper part was about to be restored - you can also easily tell which stones are anique and which are replaced by their colorthe exit-though-the-giftshop-thingy: well, this isnt a ""giftshop"" anymore... thats a whole maze of shops. no, i dont exaggerate - if felt like an extra village right at the exit of the temple area with dozens of souvenir stands.i cannot really count this as a negative to the temple, but.. maybe to the circumstances: in contrary to bali, java is far less touristic, therefore - if you arent asian -  you ""stand out"" even more - since an the neighbors island hindu temples are pretty common, you wont see this at prambanan, but on borobudur you wont have a 10-minute-break from locals/asian tourists: ""mister/miss, can i talke a photo of/with you?"" is the most common sentance youll encounter there, and youll become a far more interesting attraction than the temple itself__________________first off: yes, we did some research before we visited this temple. we tried to get there as cheap as possible and pay as little as possible for the entry... well, make the most of what we paid for, in short (read on below)how-to get to borobudur w/o paying much:checklist:1. buy a sarong. (skip the scarf, there was just one temple on my whole trip (java&bali) in which they insisted on a scarf and you had to borrow one (ulun danu batur temple @ bali)) seriously, this is much cheaper than borrowing one (sometimes you have to pay for it) and saves you complications. (for example: if you leave the main temple area you have to return your borrowed sarong and you cannot return later - if you decide to take some awesome sunset photos... also, tourists that brought their own sarongs arent told to leave the main temple area before 18:00 (closing time), since the staff wants to collect their own sarongs early)2. if you are a student, get yourself an international student card. i dont say, that it isnt possible to get discount (50%!) with just your national one - since this worked for my girlfriend - but since she was told that usually they dont give discount when you can just show your national one...3. sunscreen, even if you are a mediterranean kid like me - this is at the equator and there are almost no trees that offer some shade (you want to resemble a red lobster?)from yogyakarta: get on the trans jogja bus line 2A or 2B (yellow/green buses - buses are comfortable and pretty new) - there are almost everywhere bus stations. you just pay 3k RP for the whole way to jombur bus station. ask the staff of the trans jogja bus station for the bus to borobudur - ignore the drivers that try to get you to private tours. get on the bus to borobudur (usually really old buses with small seats - you will have to pay inside the bus - prices may differ here, but you wont pay more than 25k RP)when you get to the borobudur station ignore the drivers that try to get you to the temple. it's just a simple 15min walk.. you WILL have to pay the TOURIST entrance fee (well, locals have to pay just a fraction of what youll have to pay as a tourist) - BUT: if you plan to visit also prambanan, get the combi-ticket (you have to ask for it). (this ticket can also be used on different days - you dont have to visit both temples on the same day)side note: if you plan on visiting borobudur and want to see eighter the sunrise or sunset there, there is no way in doing this by public transportation, since earliest bus is after sunrise/latest before sunset. (taxi from borobudur -> yogyakarta?)if you want to go for the sunrise youll have to consider booking a ""sunrise tour"" by manohara. also, to my information, manohara seems to be the only provider of sunrise tours, since the borobudur temple opens at 6:00 (sunrise is at 5:00))side note: there is a saying, that if you manage to touch the hands of a budda inside of the stupas, you can make a wish - i guess the builders calculated the distance from the holes to the budda-hands to be greater than the arm of an average indonesian (rather petite physique) - you can sometimes see people trying anyways ;)",2014-11-19,Couples,2014-10,germany,51.1638175,10.4478313

Jakarta,4.0,"Perched in the middle of an ancient lake visible from Google Earth, this temple has always captivated thousands of visitors every year. And I have to say, it is indeed worth visiting to get a glimpse of the era when Java island was dominated by Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms.The best time to visit this temple is either early in the morning when the sun is not yet high, or late afternoon when you can then travel a sufficient distance to take a photo of the sunset with the temple as its fore subject. It is captivating to look at the sunset with the temple's silhouette, which I can still remember as my childhood memory after being lost in the temple and become the last visitor to leave the temple complex at around 6 PM closing time.Before visiting the temple, it is worth reading a book which can give you a good summary of the stories of the reliefs on the temple walls. Otherwise, you may wish to hire a guide which is always available at the foreign tourist gate. Note, foreign nationals are required to pay 9 times higher than locals i.e. IDR 270,000 compared to locals. This kind of discrimination bewilders me even though I am a local as I believe, the whole temple complex should have been better maintained with the whole admission fees received throughout the year.As a copycat act of Balinese temple's ritual, tourists are now required to wear a waist wrap cloth called ""sarong"" which I believe is actually a ridiculous attempt to cast a mystic aura upon the temple whilst this was not done when I visited it as a child. Ladies, if any of the locals try to wrap the cloth around your waist, just politely refuse and take the sarong and wrap it around your waist on your own to avoid groping.The front gates are now equipped with metal detectors due to the threat from Islamic States to bomb this precious monument of human architectural and intelligence achievement, although I would think the security guard's awareness is still insufficient to detect any incoming threat.Spend around  1 - 2 hours to do justice to this temple, along with your reference about the reliefs as there is no inscription available at all to explain the stories embedded in the reliefs. Taking an umbrella with you will be good to protect yourself from the baking heat and skin cancer.Going out of the temple, there is a sinister trap awaiting for you. The way to the exit point is put in circles with the intention to lure visitors to the long naves of stalls selling low quality products at a high price. Recent news told that the stalls were burnt down due to short-circuit but I have no idea if they have been rebuilt.When exiting the temple through the stairs, take the right pathway until you reach a T junction with a signage pointing right as the exit and another one pointing left to the Borobudur museum. Take the right turn via the asphalt road and do not enter even glance at the exit sign put in front of the gates to the market stalls as this is a sinister trap which will cost you at least, 30 minutes by going around in circles in the long labyrinth of stalls.Based on my above notes, I can only grant 4 out of 5 scores for this attraction.",2014-11-17,Friends,2014-09,indonesia,-2.4833826,117.8902853

Now I came once again with my family for a bit of nostalgia and to show my daughter about this historic place.Borobudur has changed a lot. Its surrounding is decorated with beautiful park. However, coming in midday turns out to be a very bad decision. At 12.00 pm the place is excruciatingly hot. Because of high level humidity and low wind, I got soaked with sweat in no time. The commercial area around the temple was NOT tourist friendly. Altough as a native I can get a good bargain, the sellers and the umbrella rentals however is extremely aggresive and insistent.  I remember having said no for maybe more than 5 times but the same guy kept shoving his umbrella to be rented. Its the yelling that made him stop (I'm really not proud of doing this).

"Bratislava, Slovakia",4.0,"Honestly, Borobudur temple is much nicer than Prambanan. It is one of the Indonesia highlight so you definitely must visit it. It is unusual, with nice surrounding and options to loose crowds in the park. However, the price for ticket is not what you would expect. $20 for 2h spent there is quite enough. If you are adventurous, you have to take public bus. From Malioboro to Jombor station and from there the bus to Borobudur. The drive there took app 2 - 2,5 hours but it was definitely worth it.

"Quezon City, Philippines",5.0,"Being the biggest Buddhist temple in the world, and the top tourism destination in Indonesia, Candi Borobudur is a must-see for anyone visiting Indonesia.I decided to see both the sunrise tour and the regular tour of Borobudur. The sunrise tour involves waking up very early and going to the monument at 4:30 am. This tour is managed by the Manohara Hotel, located within the grounds of Borobudur. Flashlights are provided to manage the steep climb to the top. A broad avenue leads to Borobudur. In the pre-dawn darkness, only a dim outline of the famous monument can be seen from here. At the end lies a flight of steps up a hill on which Borobudur itself stands. And then one gets to see the monument in full. The steps up to the top level are steep and it is good to note that there are handrails covered with anti-slip material to facilitate climbing. At the top there were only relatively few tourists - one of the advantages of a sunrise tour is that one beats the busloads to the top! It was tantalizing to see the early morning sun dispel the darkness and reveal stupa after stupa of Borobudur.The quality of sunrise during my visit was marred by clouds, but the dawn light offers fantastic photographic opportunities.Afterwards I did the regular tour of Borobudur. Unlike the peace and quiet of the sunrise tour, the regular morning tour involves busloads of tourists, mostly local, rushing to the top. However, it allows a proper appreciation of the reliefs for which Borobudur is famous. The reliefs are better seen with a tour guide who can tell the story.After this I saw the Borobudur ship in the Borobudur ship museum, and went out through the exit lined with colorful shops selling anything from scale models of Borobudur to mortars and pestles made from volcanic rock. The vendors can be pushy but a walk through the exit is a colorful modern-day finale to a Borobudur tour.",2014-10-23,Solo,2014-10,philippines,12.7503486,122.7312101

Bangkok,5.0,"The most impressive cultural heritage I personally have seen in Southeast Asia is defenitely Borobodur (also: Borobudur) in central Java. It's a huge, stepped pyramid built in the 8th century CE as a destination for (not only) buddhist pilgrims. The magnificience of this architectonical and stylistic unique monument lies not only in the craftmanships perfection, but also in the message.The pilgramage to Borobodur was meant as a spiritual execution of the buddhist approach to wisdom and enlightenment. The ancient pilgrims first approached the main monument on a three kilometers long procession road which started at Candi Mendut (Mendut temple) and led via Candi Pawon to the main monument of Borobodur. There the pilgrims circumnavigated the several levels of the monument who are ornamented with thousands of relief panels depicting the buddhist cosmos. As further one approaches the top of the pyramid as more abstract the reliefs get. Reaching the top of the sacral building symbolized purification and enlightenment.For a more detailled introduction to Borobodur I recommend you to visit http://www.asienreisender.de/borobodur.htmlwhich gives a lively description of the monument, it's history together with plenty of images and a map of the sight's surroundings.",2014-10-13,Solo,2013-11,thailand,7.4931858,124.724704

Ultimately i was personally visiting a historic edifice studied in History books and that was  a humbling experience.After finishing the temple tour made my way to the museum whose path was lined with tourist hawkers selling souvenirs..The museum had English language subtitles and hence i refreshed my school history lessons and also got to understand Buddhism a little better .There were two cages near the museum with chickens as a sign of good luck.These were the luckiest chickens on Planet Earth.From the museum made my way to the exit and boarded a horse tonga for the short journey to the bus stop and back to my residence in Yogyakarta.Its a complete full day tour.",2014-10-02,Solo,2014-08,india,22.3511148,78.6677428

"Calgary, Canada",5.0,"First of all I have visited temples and world heritage sites all over Southeast Asia thinking I was all templed out, and you know what i mean if you have explored these spectacular temples in places like Cambodia and Siem Reap and Ankor Wat, Thailand, Loas, Vietnam and China. The Borobudur Temple is exceptional and makes you appreciate the amazing vision and beliefs of these people 1000's of years ago. Rediscovered only a few hundred years ago this temple is in excellent condition and the feeling of walking around within the temple is very rewarding. Worth it in very way to visit.There are plenty of guides outside voicing to get your attention with the single word ""sunrise"" wanting to be your guide. They should have a headset tour like the Forbidden Palace in Beijing where you can wear the headset to tell you special interest information throughout the temple. We drove about one hour from Yogyakarta on a scooter to visit the ruins and bought our tickets at the Manahari (spelling) Hotel situated on the same grounds of the temple. Yu can stay there and get reduced entrance tickets and also get special entrance before sunrise to get more spectacular photos as the sun rises. We also parked at the resort hotel rather than using the main gate which does not open until later in the morning for the crowds.Staying at the hotel can save you a total of $30 off the hotel room rate so making it more affordable for a one night stay and gives you the benefit of getting some great sunrise photos before the crowds show up.This temple is spectacular and in excellent condition.

India,5.0,"The first thought that occurs to you on setting your eyes on this great stupa is that the ages have not been able to diminish its glory. This mammoth stone blocks monument lay hidden under the overgrowth of bushes and vegetation before Raffles could bring it to the notice of modern civilization. Thus discovered the monument had to wait for nearly hundred years before its restoration in the true sense could be undertaken. But Gods did not favour attention of the mortals and the nearby Mount Merapi, which stands as a mute testimony of this glorious monument, erupted with a violent frenzy covering the monument with ash and mud. But the ingenuity of man and his spirit to overcome the fury of Gods makes a saga of restoration operation that was undertaken by UNESCO post 2010 Merapi earthquake. Thanks to these noble efforts humanity has found again this jewel of historical age. For visitors it may also be important to note that the steps leading to the top of the stupa are not an easy ascent for elderly persons. The steps are high (some of them more than 14"" to 16"" high) and uneven. Besides the stairway passage is quite narrow. But if you climb atop the reward is manifold. After every flight of about 10 steps there is a platform that a visitor can circumambulate and see the vast array of Buddhist sculptures mainly depicting 'Jataka' stories. The view of the surrounding is also wonderful. In the temple complex other noteworthy places worth visiting are Manohra hotel with its library that has small but interesting collection and Ship Museum. This museum is important for the fact that the South Indian kings who navigated the seas to reach this distant land had the well-developed skills to build such ships at the time (eighth and ninth century AD). Hotel Manohara, though a kind of boutique hotel is pricey but its small library must not be missed.Before you leave the Temple Complex don't forget to return the sarong, which is offered to every visitor while entering to cover himself as a mark of respect to Gods.Could there be a scope for suggestion for such a superlative monument? Yes. The price differential between domestic and foreign visitor which is 30K and 230K respectively. Understood that this money goes for the noblest cause, when a particular monument becomes world's heritage it belongs to all the people of the world. It is only incidental that it is located at a particular place in a particular country, there should be no discrimination and the ways and means should be found to generate additional revenue from the foreign tourists. On way back visitors may well stop at Paramban Temples or simply take a pillion ride on motorbike drivers who ferry visitors for a small fee (Indonesian Rupiah 3k to 5K till the highway).",2014-09-22,Solo,2014-09,india,22.3511148,78.6677428

"Gold Coast, Australia",5.0,"Borobudur Temple is a 'must see' when in Yogyakarta.  I stayed at the closest hotel to the temple which was great to access the temple.  The grounds are beautiful in themselves, plenty of shade to sit and admire this wonderful site from all angles.  I purchased the sunrise and sunset tour package at a discounted rate because the hotel is on the site - approximately AU$20 each.  Some were complaining about the cost but as this was the purpose of my visit I did not mind at all.  We were given a torch to walk the path to the temple at 4.30am.. if you are staying in Yogyakarta you will have to allow at least 1 hours prior to get there in time for the sunrise.  It is quite a steep climb to the top - take water with you and be warned that the local sellers are very intent on making you purchase - be polite but insistent - they will follow you a long distance before giving up.  I was quite lucky that the sunrise and sunset were good when I visited however please be respectful that others have travelled long distances to photograph the same view.  At sunset a group of 4 ladies surrounded the buddha statue with tripods and simply would not allow anyone else to encroach on 'their' territory so the best photo opportunities were missed.

malaysia,5.0,"definitely the main attraction of Yogyakarta, maybe there has been so many reviews that it falls from number 1 attractions listing. Took the sunrise package, start travel at 4am and after 45min arrive at the entrance/resort and proceed to climb up. there is a torchlight provided, so it helps to guide the short walk to the temple and start the climb in the dark. once at the top, you will have to find a spot and since I intend on taking the sunrise pic with the statue of buddha, it is on the right side of one floor before the top. You will see many people with their tripod booking the spot. I find the tripod a bit selfish for such a tight spot because it deprive others from of spaces but if you do need to, place the camera on the floor of the top floor. the sunrise is beautiful and against the misty jungle setting , great scenery. you can hang around and explore the different layers which has more buddha statues in different posses which has different meaning, the top is suppose to represent a mountain. so all the buddha position is facing out with. the crowds from the daytime ticket will comes in much later but by then I have covered the 2ns levels and on the way down,so it was a relief.on the way out, then I only have the chance to admire the full temple because I climb up in the dark.:) do take note the ticket price is a bit steep at USD35, it does comes with light breakfast and a souvenir in the form of a scarf, upon return of the torchlight.",2014-09-18,Couples,2014-09,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823

You'll be able to watch the temple reveal itself in the light and see the mist lift off the jungle.  By about 7:00 or so large, noisy groups started rolling in and it was feeling quite crowded.  There is very little shade, so I'd imagine the sun would start to feel pretty intense by about 9:00; another reason to get there early.If you have seen Angkor Wat, this might not quite live up to that standard, but it's nice nonetheless.",2014-09-03,Couples,2014-09,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882

,5.0,"This is the largest Buddist temple in the world.  It is a beautiful monument and a must see.  In particular, the sunrise is spectacular and difficult to put into words.   It is like a visual crescendo that lasts for over 1 hour.   It starts with climbing to the top of this 9 level (3 round plarforms on top of six rectangular platforms) temple in complete darkness following a dim torchlight, before the beginning of the sunset at 530am.  Then, to the east, the sky slowly begins to light up with pale shades of orange, yellow and blue, exposing the silouette of the main bell shaped dome, 72 surrounding stupas of similar shape and Mount Merapi and Merabau in the distance. As the light increases, the lush green surrounds are exposed covered in a heavenly mist almost as if you are not on earth.  Then the sun appears like a fireball increasing the intensity of the light and changing the colour of the monument from a dull grey to vibrant shades of yellow, orange and brown.   And then, in full sunlight, the sky creates a vivid blue cancass against which this masterpiece boasts like a Monet.  When the ""performance"" is complete you can spend several hours marvelling at the 2,672 beautifully conditioned reliefs  statues and 504 budda statues surrounding the first 6 levels of the temple.  A truely religious experience that I will never forget, justifiably one of the Seven Wonders of the World and a mandatory addition to any bucket list.  I would say however the experience would be significantly lessened without the sunrise and that the few hours of sleep given up are more than worth the investment!  Also (because I read some commentary on this), it is different to Ankor Wat, and for me they are equal with respect to the temple and architecture, but the sunrise experience made Borobudhur more special for me.",2014-09-03,,,,,

Apparently, the 'Beautiful Morning' tour does not include sunrise viewing.Anyway, Borobudur is about an hour drive from the city, and the scenery along the way was really nice. When we arrived, we handed our payment (IDR230k; students get a discounted rate) to the driver and he gave us our entrance tickets which included either free water or coffee/tea, which you can only avail prior to entering the temple grounds. There are also a number of guides you can hire at the temple entrance.And because it was already past 6:00 am when we got there, it was already a bit crowded. The carvings are nice and intricate, but wasn't something new to me. I think if you've already been to Angkor Wat, you will no longer be wowed by it. And since the temple is in the middle of a landscaped park, it doesn't feel 'ancient' to me.

The temple is huge and surrounded by a very nice park, its all well maintained and understandably gets crowded.

Climb up to the top level, its a bit steep but the stairs are quite even and its OK. On the top level there is a serene, spiritual aspect to the temple which is striking - at least to me. There are so many stupas and angles in the construction that actually it can swallow a large number of people without any problem at all and one can steel feel almost alone. Superb views from the top as well. One cautionary note..... on exit you are directed down a set route which winds for about 500 meters past and through a vast number of stalls selling all the usual tat.

Once the sun rises beside Mount Merapi you could observe the mist slowly disappearing.Other tips:- hire a tour guide. This place is full of history and archaeological wonders which makes you appreciate it more.- Since you may stay a bit longer when the sun is up to take great pictures, its recommended to bring a water bottle since the place is huge.FYI:- Foreigners pay much more than the locals.",2014-08-07,Couples,2013-09,indonesia,-2.4833826,117.8902853

"Albuquerque, NM",4.0,"Borobudur is a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist Temple in Magelang, Central Java, Indonesia. The monument consists of six square platforms topped by three circular platforms and is decorated with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues. A main dome, located at the center of the top platform, is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues seated inside a perforated stupa. It is the world’s largest Buddhist temple, as well as one of the greatest Buddhist monuments in the world.Getting to Borobudur .....  it is located 40 km northwest of Yogyakarta, 7 km south of the town of Magelang, Central Java.  One can get to it by tour bus, mini bus, taxi or car.Now after having heard so much of this place, we decided to rent a car with a driver from a travel agency and we paid 300,000 rupiahs (Sgd$32) for a 7 hrs round trip.  We left our hotel in Jalan Dagen in Malioboro at 8am and after a scenic drive through the small villages, a stone carving town, rice fields and district offices, we reached the temple grounds at 9.15am.  Our driver advised us that the parking fees and the entrance fees were on us and that was made known to us when we booked the package the day before.The entrance fees were..... Indonesian local IDR 30.000, Indonesian local children IDR 12.500,Foreigner - Adult USD20 and Foreigner - Student [registered] USD10.  We chose to pay in rupiah and it was 235,000 per person.  We were issued a coupon each for bottled water before entering the temple grounds.  It was a good 15 minutes walk to reach the base of the temple and all visitors had to put on a sarong over their attire from the waist down. It was truly magical looking up at the temple when we were approaching it about 50 metres away from the base.  Borobudur Temple was built by Sailendra dynasty between 750 and 842 AD.  In terms of world wide religious structures, it was very early, it would be 300 years before Cambodia’s Angkor Wat was constructed, 400 years before work began on the great European cathedrals.At this time the Saliendra dynasty built a great number of monuments, both Hindu and Buddhist, in the region there are even temples where the two religions combine, alternating symbolism. We had to walk up the first flight of steps, circled around it before proceeding to the next one and it had several tiers before we reached the stupas and the dome.  The views at the temple and the valley below were just spectacular!  Even it was only morning at this time of the day, the weather was already hot and humid and lucky for us, we brought our umbrellas to escape the direct heat.  The entire tour at the temple and taking pictures leisurely took us about 2 hrs.  Then we went down to tour the Ship Museum and The Museum at the National Archaelogical Park which were located near the souvenir stalls lining the path leading out of the temple grounds to the car park.  It was not pleasant having the souvenir sellers following and hassling us all the way to the museums and a good advise was to be firmed always and not to show any interest in their wares! This historic place was educational and an eye opener into restoration works taken in 1814 by Raffles, who was known as a great admirer of history and culture. He alerted the rest of the world to its existence and commissioned a clear up of the site, removing the trees, undergrowth and earth that had built up.  In 1907 to 1911 this site saw significant restorations lead by Theo Van Erp.  Then UNESCO and the Indonesian government undertook a complete overhaul of the monument in a big renovation project from 1975 to 1983.It is a MUST to tour this historic temple when you are in Yogjakarta!",2014-07-18,Couples,2014-07,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882

"Sydney, Australia",5.0,"A few pointers from my humble perspective:1. If your serious with your photography and plan to be there for sunrise or sunset, bring a tripod. There's very little point without one as you'll need to use high ISO meaning high noise.2. Spend your time and don't rush. Walking the various levels and marvel at the bass reliefs will surprise you ""if"" your patient. From my observation 95% of tourists went straight to the top and then back down! You don't need a guide if you do some research about the bass reliefs first.3. The dynamic range is very very high (ie. sky is always much brighter than the temple). So bracket your shots in order to blend them together in photoshop.4. Bring water and a snack, that will avoid rushing up and down like the majority.5. Bring an umbrella if forecast is for rain. While the majority of people will head back down, having an umbrella will have you happily snapping away for hours unhurried. There is a huge added benefit of rain, it covers the temple in a sheen of water which makes for great images.6. Sleep close by. The 3 closest hotels are: Hotel Manohara, Paksi Coffee House, Cempaka. Menohara is very expensive and lacks the charm compared to the latter two but is the closest.7. For the reason in #3 above, I think the best photos are those that are taken:- before sunrise shooting towards the east. By the time the sun rises the best light is over.- after sunset shooting westerly (same point as sunrise).- just after sunrise and before sunset by using the temple as foreground as the soft light is imparted on the temple, reliefs and buddha.- during the day (assuming not cloudy) the sun is far too harsh to make any great images.8. Avoid flashing your torch around while other photographers are trying to make their shots. This sounds obvious but apparently many people there at the time didn't have this level of common courtesy.9. Avoid being loud, show respect. Again, a point of common courtesy in such a spiritual place. This seemed to be respected by the local visitors and budget travellers, however it was something that the ""higher-end"" tourists (let's class them as that) seemed to ignore. Perhaps unsurprisingly those same loud people tended to be the ""huff and puff and whinge on the walk up, make a sunrise snap, rush back to their big breakfast or back on the bus"".Enjoy, be patient, be respectful and smile.",2014-07-14,Solo,2014-07,australia,-24.7761086,134.755

The art is a beautiful mix between the Buddhist knolage that came from India and local ancestor worship, I am lost for words you have to see and experience the place for yourself, I think everyone will find something different, for me as a student of both Buddhism and of ancient artifacts and the esoteric history of the world this place was very special. Not only the temple but the position is right between two sacred mountains and two sacred rivers, up there with the prymids in Egypt and south america, the temples of Angkor and india. A true world heratige site, I fell in love. A couple tips, if your not on a tour group, we found thatno taxis wait around the place like you would find at Angkor or Thailand, so if you taxi there ask them to pick you up after at a set time, also apparently of you want to see sunrise here the gates don't open until 6 and sunrise is earlier most of the year sao you'll have to book a special tour, still pretty cheap and easy to sort out.

We took bus 2B to Jombo terminal and then got on another bus to Borobudur. The 2nd bus to Borobudur is not state-owned and not air-conditioned. It takes about one hour from Jombo terminal to Borobudur. The bus doesn's stop in front of Borobudur temple. You need to walk around 1 kilometer to get there. The ticket to Borobudur temple has 2 kinds. One for domestic and the other for foreigners. Indonesian only pay RP 30K for the tickets and foreigners have to pay USD$30 for the ticket. After entering the temple yard, you'll see one ancient building like a cone. I would say my excitement only last about 10 seconds. After you climb up to the top level, you'll have aesthetic fatigue soon. You'll find they are all the same and the whole building is just one, kind of few.

It was difficult to walk anywhere and even more difficult to find the beauty and peace of this spectacular UNESCO site.  I had visited Borobudur Temple in 1998, 2 months after some terrible times in Indonesia.  Our small group was literally alone on the site.  That was a magical and mystical experience, so I couldn't wait to return.This visit was an entirely different experience.  It was like Times Square at midnight on New Years Eve.  Or like a subway car at rush hour.  The ""plus"" was that everyone was polite and did their best to make a bad situation tolerable.  It was actually a bit of fun to be treated like movie stars by the Javanese teenagers.  We were among the only Westerners on the site, and had our photos (shyly) taken by group after group of young people.  Also, we did get to see a procession of monks who were there, perhaps in conjunction with the major holiday of Waisak.  Borobudur has also been invaded by sellers of absolutely everything.  They'll mob you as you descend from the temple.  You'll walk through a large shopping area as you exit.

,5.0,"Visited this UNESCO monument from Yogyakarta....the truth is Borobudur is one of the outstanding Buddhist temple that Indonesia could ever have. It was designed in Javanese Buddhist architecture, which blends the Indonesian indigenous cult of ancestor worship and the Buddhist concept of attaining Nirvana. And frankly it is the world’s largest Buddhist temple, as well as one of the greatest Buddhist monuments in the world.Evidence suggests Borobudur was constructed in the 9th century and abandoned following the 14th-century decline of Hindu kingdoms in Java and the Javanese conversion to Islam. The temple also demonstrates the influences of India upon the region, yet there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian. Thus they the Javanese had created Borobudur themselves to be the largest and most complete ensemble of Buddhist reliefs in the world.It is much better to hire a guide when you made the entry payment at the entrance as you would get a better understanding of the Borobudur itself. The only minus factor that you get from this place is THE HARASSMENT that you would definitely get when you made the exit at the departure gate - which is from all STREET PEDDLERS selling their goods. Even though you told them that you are not interested to buy their goods but they refused to listen to you. THE TRUTH IS YOU ARE BEEN HARASSED BY AT LEAST MORE THE TEN OF THEM all at once.

But I preferred looking on the different levels rather than the top which was crowded with other tourists. Usually I don't mind other tourists, I expect them. However be prepared as they are mostly local tourists who don't see westerners very often. Be prepared to have many strangers ask to take your photo, and follow you, and take your photo without permission.

I was followed at one point by 5 people for a distance of 50m. Surrounding me and hassling me. Once out you are also forced to negotiate a maze of market stalls with no directions designed for people to get lost in. Don't get me wrong, it's worth a look.

To quote from this article:  “The temple was used as a Buddhist temple from its construction until sometime between the 10th and 15th centuries when it was abandoned. Since its re-discovery in the 19th century and restoration in the 20th century, it has been brought back into a Buddhist archaeological site.”  “Rediscovery” is a good word because tourists from all over the world as well as Buddhist pilgrims and hundreds of students on field trips come by the busloads.  We hired a taxi, costing us about Rp 800,000 [$80 and that included getting there and back as well as our entrance fees].  It was a really worthwhile day, starting at 6:00 in the morning when our driver picked us up at our hotel.  We went early because we were warned that later in the day, it would be even more crowded.  It’s 42 Km or 30 miles, so it’s good to get an early start and beat the traffic going through the city.  Borobudur is a photographer’s dream and an artistic wonder - starting with the overview from afar, then the stairs up to the square terraces covered in magnificent and aesthetically beautiful reliefs. Your eye will also take in the many statues of Buddhas in niches.  The finest part is at the very top where you can see mountain views, but more importantly, bell-like stupas and buddha statues crowning this architecturally exquisite monument.

If you have some serious knee or joint problems, climbing to the top may not be the option, but you one still need to climb a few steps just to get to the exit.Be prepared for some constant haggling by the vendors at the exit gate.

Although they do special sunrise tours for a more hefty price, we decided to go during the normal opening hours at 6am. A tip-go in the morning or evening as it gets very hot in the afternoons. You don't really need a guide as you can read about the temple beforehand. The beautiful carvings on the walls relates the story of Buddha and his teachings. Good view at the highest point of the structure. Photography enthusiasts would enjoy the numerous panoramic opportunities to take pictures.

Wonder among the stupas as you wait for the sunset when  the crowds have left, the temperature cools and you can enjoy the quiet and perhaps the soft chanting of a group of monks.There are a few negatives which have nothing to do with the temple itself. It is quite expensive and there are no facilities within the temple grounds. We would like to have gone out for some refreshments and then returned but we were told we would have to pay again, even though we would return on the same day.When leaving the temple if visiting during the day, the routte we had to follow took us on a 20 minute walk through markets, having to walk up and down the aisles with no relief from the heat. Thought I would pass out.If you are visiting Prambanan Temples as well you can buy a combined ticket for a discounted price.

And it's a temple to many of them instead of just a tourist attraction. But still. At least foreigners should pay twice the price max to make it reasonable and fair. But I hope my money is put into the  maintaining of this temple. I've been here many times and these days you have to wear a sarong. You get one for free (well, it includes the fee). Interesting as this is a Buddhist temple therefore a sarong is not mandatory. Other then that. The tremple is stunning! It is one of my favourite temples in the world. Worth a visit. And be prepared. Local people would love to go on the photo with you. Enthusiastic kids and adults. You can't say no to these kind people. And you end up with unique photos.

From the drop off point to the main entrance, one has still to walk about 500m. Once inside, move to the left and you'd find a 2 step stairs where you can take a group picture with a panaromic view of the temple as a backdrop. No other place positions you better than this.The unfortunate thing about this place is the many headless statues. Apparently pilfered by vandals. Security is lax and the place huge and open. The view is good from level 3 up. There are only 4 levels of stairs to climb. But, be warned, the last flight to the 4th level is the steepest and narrowest - allowing only one lane up and down.One can take many scenic shots - see if you can find a statue where you can stand behind it and shoot a panaromic view of what he is looking at.The return trip exiting the temple forces you to past the multitude of street vendors hankering for your attention.

It is worth the extra money to arrive early and have the entire place to yourself until the 'hordes' arrive after the 06 public opening. The climb up the stairs by flashlight (torch) is very nice! To sit for that hour before the sunrise and contemplate all that has taken place at this location over its 1500 year history is incredible. The art and culture displayed here is magnificent. As the light comes up and more of the Temple comes into view, the pictures begin to explain all that there is to see there. The early entry allowed for many 'unobstructed' photos. Our guide, Supy, did a great job of discussing and explaining what has gone on from the initial build to its desertion, to rediscovery and the several rebuilding efforts that have and are taking place! We were there for about 3 hours and really enjoyed the time and early serenity.Borobudur is definitely NOT an accessible site, as the stairs are MANY and STEEP! It is worth the time and effort to get up to the top and explore the several layers as you move back down. There are a few 'hawkers' trying to see various things just out the exit gate area, and they had some interesting items. They were polite and did not push.As we left the front area about 0900, There was a standing line of at least AT LEAST 1000 people waiting to get in!

"Sydney, Australia",4.0,"Going to Yogyakarta or the surroundings and missing out on Borobudur would be a no-no. This is the biggest attraction in the area and for a reason: it is beautiful and impressive. Not to be missed.There are a few points that I'd like to stress out:-There is an entrance for locals, and a different one for foreigners (that is of course 10 times more expensive). At the international entrance they ask you to wear a sarong which instantly segregates you from the locals. Apparently it is to show respect but plenty tourists were walking around in short shorts and sleeveless tops. Everyone has to wear it, even if you have long pants.-You are given a small bottle of water on arrival (or tea/coffee up to you), bottle which I found left empty everywhere around the site. The temple is littered with them, which is such a shame. I can't generalise but it seems to me that it is the locals that throw them everywhere and the tourists that put them in the bins provided-The same can be said for cigaret butts. The temple is non smoking, the sign is clear at the front, yet I noticed plenty locals smoking. Most people visiting are overwhelmingly muslims which prompts me to ask: what if I acted like they do in their mosque, how would they feel?-If you are a tourist, you will be stopped countless of times by teenagers to take pictures. This is a fun time for everyone and they are more than happy to pose for your camera too.-You can access the temple from Yogyakarta. Town bus to Jombor bus terminal then another bus for Borobudur. They leave every hour and cost 20 000 rupiah. Once the bus drops you off, it is only 500 meters walk to the entrance (tuk tuk drivers will tell you it is much more so you buy a ride)-We went in the afternoon until closing time so we caught 'golden hour' for photography. I recommend it. The temple wasn't too crowded (I was expecting a lot worse). -Finally, the last bus back to town leaves at 5.40pm and it is packed with people as it is the only one.

It's a 4:30 start and a long waiting on the temple's platforms in the dark but the moment the sun rises and dawn appears it is an awesome experience. I have done it three times and each time looked different. Alternatively be in front of the gates at 6am and get in before the buses arrive. Also most of the store owners have not opened yet and will not bother you too much. Morning hours are the best and unless you want detail information, I would go alone and explore each level of the temple and the area around it. There are nice park-like areas behind the temple.

"Jakarta, Indonesia",4.0,"This temple is absolutely worth the 1.5 hour drive from jogja. This was my third visit to this temple, but my first in recent years. This temple never fails to amaze me. A look at it would leave one wondering how human hand were able to build it during its time. We arrived just less than an hour prior to closing time, which helped a bit as some of the crowd were starting to leave. Arriving at that time of the day means you'll get a chance to see the sunset from the temple. Unfortunately it was a cloudy evening which hindered what would have been a spectacular sunset view. My favourite part had always been the top level where all the stupas are. It is also the best spot for photo taking. As we were one of the last bunch to leave, for some minutes we had the top level almost to ourselves which we really enjoyed. The serenity of the temple with almost no one else around put my mind at peace. We also had the chance to observe how the temple guards worked efficiently to clear the temple at closing time, which was something new and interesting to me. I'd suggest that one should avoid visiting the temple during the long weekends and local school holidays as there would be crowds of domestic visitors and school children. I am very sad and disappointed to see the way fellow indonesians visitors are treating this temple. While i was there it wasn't uncommon to see plastic bottles being left on the stupas and locals climbing on the stupas while posing for photos. I imagine this could only be worse during the daytime. Not only this is embarrassing and inappropriate, it also tarnishes the image of local visitors in the eyes of foreign visitors. I do hope that the temple operators do more to educate visitors to treat this magnificent temple with the respect it deserves. The temple guards tried their best to install some discipline by continuously yelling at visitors who tried to climb the stupas. But there can't possibly be enough of them to supervise all visitors all day long. Perhaps they should start limiting the number of visitors on a daily basis.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",5.0,"As i mentioned earlier in my first review, the main attraction going to Yogjakarta is Borobudur. Not going to Borobudur as though your holiday to Yogjakarta in not complete. Borobudur is a cultural heritage and recognized by UNESCO as world heritage site. I do believed the history of Borobudur shift from century to century as a story of the people but till to-date Borobudur holds the mark of Buddhism in South East Asia and the mixture of culture and religion in the architectural.Each traveler or visitors have their own concept of holidays and to few maybe Borobudur is just an ancient story with no impact to individual or human being. It is different with me as I still believed to know the country we have to know the history and to know the people you have to learn the culture. Respect gained from knowing and Borobudur kept a long secret of humanity till today. From my reading Borobudur still pay homage to Vesak Day celebrate by Buddist all over the nation. Although there are different epic of Buddism from Thailand, Burma and Indonesia they still have the similarity and connection which gave a person or a reader deep meaning of humanity.Going up Borobudur at the early hours in the morning (4.30am) to catch the sunrise will somehow stir a feeling in anyone soul (unless they don't have it...hehehe :)). I completely miss the sunrise because of was raining the other night and the sun did not make the appearance on the expected time. As the day light coming to out bit by bit you will be amazed by the surrounding. There are many mountains and hills around Borobudur but I only remember Mount Merapi. Mount Merapi looks so serene like a princess sleeping but when it erupt it is no mercy to anyone. I make a complete round of Borobudur and I am hoping to have the opportunity to be up there again for sunrise. Although it is my desire too to witness sunset from the top of the hill.History thought me Buddha is known for its connection with the nature and now I know why Budda choose to be up on the mountain and built his shrine. Each sign of Buddism very close to the nature and only by understanding the philosophy we will appreciate the history.To anyone who have intention to visit Borobudur, try to get a night at Princess Manohara Resort.

Most of the time I thin an european mind is not able to take all this, because we do not understand so many details. But it is simply fantastic. Within the stupas are sitting buddhas, everyone is different from the other. I think it makes sense to read something about the temple to understand at least a little bit of it´s history and meaning.

"Melbourne, Australia",4.0,"It is best to arrive at Borobudur as early as you can. It is Indonesia's top attraction and can get very busy. From Yogya it is one hours drive. The place opens at sunrise but arriving at 8am it will still be relatively quiet. I was shocked at how enormous the car-park was. This is mass tourism in action. Foreigners go through a different entry to locals, it cost $20. You can easily spend 3hrs here. My group had a Sundanese guide - his accent was difficult to understand. I recommend reading up a bit before you go - or just concentrate on one part of the temple and just study the amount of detail there is in the carvings. The natural thing to do is to go right up to the top. Get that out the way first. You will have trouble getting a photo with no one else in it. There is a major clog up around one ""lucky Buddha"" where you are meant to stretch your hand through the latticed stupa to touch the Buddha inside. I found the lower levels of the temple more interesting. There are some brilliant carvings of Buddha as a turtle rescuing people from a sea monster. On your exit the car park has been transformed into a mass of stalls selling the usual tourist trinkets. If you come in the afternoon - it will most likely rain.

"Naples, FL",4.0,"We visited Borobudur when our HA cruise docked in Semarang port, Java. We had pre-booked a very expensive tour with Borobudur Holiday Tours (still cheaper than a shore excursion with HA)and we knew that visiting the temple would involve a 4 hour drive ONE way. Our driver did not show at the terminal, but was waiting in his car!! It took phone calls by locals and time to find him. Not a good beginning. His English was not very good, although he was a good driver and drove safely. There was SOOOO much traffic getting out of Semarang and then again through all the towns on the way, many trucks, construction and congestion. Not fun. When we finally got there, we skipped lunch, because we wanted to make sure to have enough time at the temple. So we just snacked on what we had brought along. When asked if we should take rain gear on our temple walk, the driver said no, it won't rain. He then handed us off to another guide stationed at the temple entrance. If you are expecting to see something similar to Angkor Wat, you will be disappointed. It is not a complex, but ONE single big temple with many levels. It is certainly worth exploring, especially after such a long and harrowing drive to get there. We took some amazing pictures, especially when storm clouds kept gathering. Our temple guide ran to get us umbrellas and then we experienced the heavens opening up in an incredible deluge. We just huddled under the umbrella and held on as the wind picked up as well. Of course, we got soaking wet, but it was a true tropical experience We left the temple park at 3 pm and had 5 hours to make it back to port for an all aboard at 8 pm. Well, our driver decided to ""find a short-cut"" through the jungle and mountains back to port. Problem was, he did not KNOW where to find that short-cut. As the hours kept ticking away, he kept stopping asking for directions, then making a few wrong turns, before asking for Semarang again. Not a good time for us passengers as we lost all confidence in him, expecting to miss our ship. Finally, the driver asked a taxi driver to lead us into port. Thanks to this taxi, we made it out of the jungle and down the hills on a very narrow road, down to port....and made it just in time before departure. phew. We noticed that the ship's excursion busses had also just arrived in the nick of time. So, if you make the temple trip in a day, know that it will take 4-5 hours each way as traffic is horrendous. It is a world heritage site, so it is still worth it. Obviously, we can NOT recommend Borobudur Holiday Tours.",2014-05-01,Couples,2014-03,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882

London,5.0,"One of the highlights of my travels anywhere was to visit the Borobudur Temple Complex in Indonesia. I had always wanted to visit ever since seeing pictures online. I am very much interested in temples across Asia and you cannot get much more grand than Candi Borobudur! The complex is situated about an hour’s drive outside of Yogyakarta, near a town called Magelang. It is effectively in the middle of nowhere and if you are not part of an organised tour group then you will need your taxi driver to wait for you in the car park ready to take you back to your hotel, as there is no public transport readily available inside the Borobudur complex.At the time of visiting, it cost me as a foreigner IDR190,000, which in comparison to the rate of IDR30,000 for Indonesian citizens is a bit of a rip-off, but that’s the way it is in some countries. India is another country that charges more if you are a foreigner. Visiting times for the general public is usually between 06.00-17.00hrs, although if you want to see the sunrise from atop the temple, please be aware that the sun has already risen by 6am in this part of the world, regardless of season. I was not able to view the sunrise at Borobudur, although I still visited fairly early in the morning, around 9am. The place was packed with school children on the day of my visit, so I suspect it was a public holiday in Java at the time. You must wear a sarong to enter the temple grounds, and of course make sure you are not scantily-dressed in accordance to the local Islamic tradition of Indonesia. One of the main things I loved about Candi Borobudur is the style of architecture in which it is built. It is shaped like a pyramid but with walkable platforms around the entire temple so you can get great views of the surrounding jungle.There are six square platforms which take you up a level each time, and above them there are three circular platforms. Everything, however, is topped by a giant dome, situated at the top of the highest circular platform. While all this may sound confusing, the results are very pleasing on the eye. Basically, there are nine levels of the temple, with the main dome at the very peak. Each level is intensely decorated with sculptures of Buddha and other reflections of the Buddhist religion, with many stories being told in sculpture as you follow them around the perimeter of the temple.My favourite part of Candi Borobudur is the bell-shaped stupas on the upper, circular levels of the temple. It is here that you begin to realise that is no ordinary temple. Borobudur really is among the Bagan complex in Myanmar and Angkor Wat in Cambodia in terms of the grandeur of the place! One thing I noticed a lot of here was Indonesian school children asking to have their photograph taken with me, as if I was some kind of celebrity! I guess they just love the novelty of having a European guy in their photos! They can’t have too many opportunities to meet and greet the tourists in a quaint old town like Magelang. After a while I found this to be very annoying. I refused a few photos, which made me feel very bad, but I am here to experience the temple, not to pose for somebody else’s photos. When not pestering me for photos, I found all the locals – both adults and children alike – to be very polite and respectful towards me at Borobudur, which further enhances my respect and appreciation for Indonesian people and their culture.Apparently, there are 504 statues of Buddha on the temple itself, which is an incredible amount. I certainly didn’t see them all. I think I was more interested in the amazing views from the top, and of course getting my dose of photos of the famous Borobudur stupas. That said, it is impossible not to be respectful and impressed the religious significance of places such as Borobudur, and also nearby Candi Prambanan, which is situated the other side of Yogyakarta (they can easily be done in the same day, but it is around 90 minutes driver between the two sites).I found the stairs up and down from one platform to another to be quite steep, and while not exactly as scary as the ascent up Sigiriya in Sri Lanka, as a vertigo sufferer myself, I did still get a little apprehensive, especially considering the sheer volume of people at the temple on that day. You did not really get a chance to walk steadily down the stairs, you were effectively pushed down unless you walked fast enough! Additionally, it was also difficult to get some nice scenic shots from the top of Borobudur, as with so many school children around it would always spoil the view, but this is usual at the main tourist places across the world. You should try and get a nice empty shot of the Great Wall of China! Never going to happen!Overall, I was ecstatic to finally have the chance to visit Candi Borobudur. The township of Yogyakarta is not known for its luxury hotels or its nightlife, nor is it a shopping mecca full of international brand names. It does have in Borobudur, however, one of the top 3 temple complexes in Asia, and this is why people like me come in their droves here. Aside from Bali, Yogyakarta is actually the second most visited place in Indonesia for tourism.

I am a fit senior, and took a walking stick along with me just for this trip.    I needed it two or three times really to steady myself on what were some pretty steep steps, often without much to hold on to for a step or two.    DON'T LET THIS DETER YOU FROM GOING.    Its worth the climb, and even going to the first level shows you all the wonderful sculptured freizes telling the story of the life of Buddha.    Most people seem intent on climbing the steps which can leave you virtually alone to enjoy the friezes and carvings.   Higher up the number of bell shaped Stupas will amaze you.  Each one holds a statue, and on one of them the cover is removed and you can see one of the statues.   The view from the top is tremendous, and yet again, most don't walk around them.    When you enter the Temple you are given a sarong to wear, and our group thought these would be ours to keep as souveniers.

I think $20 is very pricy for a temple like this (for the same price you get to see 1000 more beautiful temples in Angkor, Cambodia)Also, we planned to visit around sunset to see it in the beautiful soft-gloomy evening light. We bought our $20 tickets and went up the temple. However, after about 15-20 minutes, right before sunset, the guards literally chased us off the temple grounds as they told us: ""buy an evening ticket for an additional 10 dollars if you want to see sunset, but you can't pay here, you have to go down to the ticket office. Only ticket office is already closed right now, so please go now!""We might have even thought it worth the extra $10 to stay a bit longer, but the ticket office didn't tell us about these rules (15 minutes before the site would close, you'd think they'd want to tell you you can buy a more expensive ticket, right??)All in all, very disappointing.",2014-04-08,Friends,2013-10,netherlands,52.2434979,5.6343227
Scottsdale,5.0,We took the sunrise tour which meant leaving our hotel in Yogyakarta at z4am but it was well worth it. We arrived when it was still dark but you could make out the huge pyramid shaped structure. They provide you with a flashlight at the entrance so that you can make your way in the dark but the paths are clean and easy to follow. We climbed as far as possible to watch daybreak but sadly there is no actual sunrise due to the combination of mist and pollution but it's still worth seeing dark shapes take form to the myriad Stupas of varying sizes. Do plan on spending at least an hour or more and walk around each of the four or five levels to see the intricacy of the bad relief carvings and remember that these were done in the 8th century so have lasted over 1200 years.,2014-04-07,Couples,2014-04,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882

It has wonderful carvings in the stone which tell many stories and our guide was very knowledgeable and translated a lot of them to us, very interesting. If you look inside the stupurs on top there are statues inside. There are alot of high, narrow steps to climb to get to the top level but relatively easy if you walk one level at a time and explore that level before ascending to the next level. It is very busy and hot so best to take water, a hat and sunscreen. Outside the gate there are many, many stalls set up with sellers trying to sell their over-priced souvenirs (a good opportunity to haggle). Its even nice to just wander or sit around in the surrounding parkland. Apparently its spectacular to see at sunrise but we went during the day.

Also at this time it was not crowded so plenty of good photo opportunities and very peaceful. Although some of the steps are quite steep there are hand rails to most so not too difficult and I am not very young or fit. The temple itself is very grand and deserves World Heritage listing, the carvings although not not all original were beautiful.

The temple complex itself is visually enchanting and have enough interest for you to spend half a day there. While, the complex is much smaller than Angkor Wat, it is completely different in architecture and the religion. The many stupas at the top of the temple are really a sight to behold. We didn't manage to do the sunrise or sunset tours but still the temple complex is really beautiful. If you don't mind to support the locals, you can hire a photographer to tag a long. They charge 3 USD per 8R photo while also showing you the best sights and also taking photos for you using your camera. Another note, you will be overwhelmed by the amount of local street pedlars of souvenirs following you throughout the journey and pestering you to buy. Of course, this can be a bit annoying but bear in mind most of them are just trying to make a living in poor conditions and certainly your tourist dough helps.

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"We have wanted to visit Borobudur for quite some time, and finally made it there last week.  We were not disappointed.I strongly suggest paying the supplement to visit at sunrise or sunset.  The skies are obviously stunning at these times.  The contrast between the of people at the top at these time and the huge crowds at other times is remarkable.  Descending from the temple just after sunrise makes you realise just how fortunate you have been; you meet huge crowds of tourists and school tours coming against you.  The contrast for sunset is even more stark because you generally ascend while it is still crowded.  It is almost impossible to take a photo without lots of other people in it.  The moment that 'normal opening hours' end, you have the place to yourself (in our case, there was one other group of 4) to take all of the photos that you could possibly want.  They never pushed us to leave either, we took the initiative to head back.  The only disappointment with the sunset session is the extraordinary amount of trash that people have left behind.  I was constantly putting plastic bottles and food wrappers in the bin as they were dominating every photo.  Even then, I keep spotting others as I flick through the photos that I've taken.We enjoyed Borobudur as much as Ankor Wat and the fact that we had it to ourselves made it even more special.",2014-04-02,Family,2014-03,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992

While you can have the benefit of a guide, you really do not need one unless you are interested in thoroughly understanding the history of all the friezes and cupolas. The best way to visit the temple is to walk all the way up to the top first, and then slowly make your way down clockwise. You will want to do this slowly, as the temple itself is a never ending voyage through art and history, and the views from all directions are beautiful. As with many attractions of this sort it is best to get there as early as possible. Borobudur has been around a long time and is very popular, and the more crowded it gets the less enjoyable it becomes. The only downside is that when you leave you have to make your way through the inevitable souvenir stalls.

To be clear: it is one of the top places to see on the planet, just the history, the size and the cultural value of it are immeasurable. BUT what they are doing with it... a disaster.It starts with a ripoff with the tickets: Kids 6 or older are considered ""adults""! This unless they can provide a ""student pass"". Right, a ""student pass"" for an 8 year old who goes to primary school. I told her the kid goes to school, or does the lady think we make our kids work at this tender age? I don't think it is a matter of lack of common sense or lack of trust, just a way to rip off tourists. As simple as that. Ok, then for the money you think they must make some effort to keep the temple clean...forget it. Everywhere and especially on the top, garbage everywhere. Food, plastic bottles, etc. insufficient number of trash bins, no enforcement. There was a lot of personnel standing or sitting lazily around, but right so, not doing anything meaningful.  Then the exit: they force you to walk through such a long and convoluted maze of souvenir shops all the way to the parking, that it is longer and takes longer that visiting the temple itself. And the souvenirs are always the same cheap stuff repeating itself. Even the sellers don't really try to sell anymore because there are too may of them mind and the tourists are just tired and don't respond anymore to the ""promotion"".

"Borobudur, Indonesia",5.0,"Im writing this in Yoko's traditional Javanese home, which I'm sharing with him and his extended family (including one of the cutest babies in the world). It's quite remarkable that we have internet access at all, since we are in a small village of around 600 people a few km from Borobudur. I'm coming to the end of an amazing few days with Yoko and I wanted to share my experience here, which isn't usually what i'm into, but the more people that get to travel with Yoko the better. This morning began with a traditional Javanese breakfast cooked by Yoko's wife. It just so happens that she does breakfast for lots of people in the village, like a local cafe, so I meet half the village as im sitting there on the front deck. Then it's off to Borobudur market where Yoko arranged for me to try loads of strange fruit that i'd never even seen, and I bought freshly boiled quails eggs on a stick for brunch. Then we took mopeds and went for a drive through the beautiful hills by the village - just breath-taking. After lunch and seista we drove to join a bunch of locals playing football, before heading to another Buddhist temple to join the monks for their evening prayer, For dinner we ate at a restuarants which is famous amoung locals for it's goat recipes - you'd never know from looking at it but it was delicious and not like any of the other local food i'd tried. I met Yoko by chance Friday morning (today's Sunday) on a hill near the Borobudur Temple where you can watch the sunrise for only 30,000 Rp entrance fee, if the Temple sunrise is out of your price range (I went to the Temple in the day which is cheaper). He was with three French travellers, i overheard them talking about their trip up Mirabi Mountain the following day, which is an active volcano in the area, started chatting and they kindly invited me to join. Yoko arranged our scooters for the trip and a guide to take us up. I was planning on doing it independently but im SO pleased I didn't as I would have had to travel along main roads rather than the beautiful country lanes we used, and i would probably have got lost and found it dificult to find a guide etc...I stayed in the guide's simple house - another taste of real Javanese living - such a lovely man and his brother took us up the volcano, also wonderfully helpful and kind. Yoko lent me all the bits of equipment i didnt have like raincoat and torch and a better climbing bag. The volcano was a epic experience - well worth doing but not for the faint-hearted! The last bit you are clambering over ash-sand and small rocks to get to the crater. Anyway, that's another story and I need to head to bed. Tomorrow I'm going to visit the village elementary school and hopefully do a few lessons (im a PE teacher), then have a go at doing pottery (Yoko's sister-in-law is one of the village potters). My main reason for writing is to say thanks to Yoko for a amazing trip, full of the sorts of cultural insights that you'd miss out without a local person who can speak english well, too many to mention here. Yoko clearly does it for the social interactions and because he loves his job, rather than for the money. He has the sensitivity of a mature man combined with the energy of a twenty-year-old. Lots of great stories the more we chatted. So thanks Yoko, and may you have many more lucky guests such as me, who arrive as customers and leave as friends.",2014-03-09,Solo,2014-03,indonesia,-2.4833826,117.8902853

You can go by car or transportation public (bus) to Magelang city around 1 hour from Yogyakarta, and then from Magelang to Borobudur village it takes 40 minutes. I have came here around 7 times, as i really amazed about this temple. It was established in Syailendra Dynasty, 1200 years ago. Can you imagine? how could the ancient people establish those big stones without cement. The temple is similar like a pyramid. It has 6 terraces and very high, that's why you should wear flat shoes as your leg would be sore to reach the highest terrace, named big stupa. Each terrace showed the symbol of Buddha's life. 1. First terrace named  ""Kamadhatu"" means the world of desire 2. Second until forth, named ""Rupadhatu"" means the world of form3. Fifth until stupa, named ""Arupadhatu"" means the world of formlessness It also has 2.672  stone carved relief regarding historical story of Buddha but you need a tour guide there, who could translate those stories. You will never regret to come here as it is really wonderful that's why UNESCO has recognized it as one of the world heritage. You can buy some souvenirs like Borobudur Temple Miniature, t-shirt, handy-craft of Javanese,  etc. It might be better come at afternoon or morning, so the temperature not so hot, but if you came at daylight that would be so hot, and you should bring hat and mineral water.",2014-02-18,Couples,2013-08,indonesia,-2.4833826,117.8902853

The path through the green lawns leading you towards the temple creates a strange feeling and excitement. This nearly 1200 year old monument is enormous in size.

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"We know that Borobudur is a unesco site. We know that it is a must-visit when you visit Joyga. But how do you ensure that you get the best of what Borobudur has got to offer? The answer is to get a good guide and a prefect timing to visit.You can get a driver to bring you to the site. However,  you need a good guide to explain to you the meaning behind the cravings on the wall of the site. One site of the wall tells you the life story of the Buddha, where the other side has pictures depicts the good teachings of Buddha. All the cravings on the wall would be meaningless if you see it as just pictures of Buddha. However with a good guide, you can appeciate this place much better and get the unexpected enlightenment from the visit. I had 2 visits to the site, one is a sunset package and the other is a sunrise package. While sunrise package is the popular one with tourists,  it is the sunset package which I enjoyed most. Through my travel agent, I had purchased the sunset package through Manohara hotel. You need not be staying in the hotel to buy the package. We walked to this site from the hotel. Like all tourists,  we listened to the guide explaining to us the cravings and took pictures of the site.  Then we saw the security officers chasing tourists down the site at 5.30pm as it was the closing hour of the place. This was when our guide told us that as the site is managed by the hotel, we were allowed to stay at the site til 6.30pm. As there are no other tourists who purchased the package through the hotel, we had the unesco site by ourselves,  how unbelievable can it be. We had an hour of the site, enjoying the serenity of the site, getting the best of what this place can offer to us. We are able to take pictures without the crowd in the background. When we exited the site, there was a hotel staff who waited for us and opened the gate for us. It's good to feel like a VIP where the site is only available to us.The next day, we bought the sunrise package and visited the site at 4.30am. It was pitch dark and we got a torchlight from the hotel before we embarked on the journey. There was a big crowd who went for the sunrise. While it can be more beautiful watching the sunrise,  the noise from the crowd is not quite a welcoming one. At about 7am, the influx of the visitors came and we decided to leave the place. It is when we compared the sunrise and sunset package and happy for ourselves that we got a good sunset package the day before.When visiting this site, it is best to wear comfortable shoes and pants as the steps are big.May you get the best value of the site through a good guide and a prefect visiting timing ^^",2014-02-13,,,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992

Unfortunately I didn't manage to come at these times, but Borobudur was still beautiful.I went there around 9am and it was already packed. There was a lot of school students doing their visit, and one of their exercises was to practice English with toursits, asked them for their autograph and to take photos with them. I kept being bombarded by students. It was my pleasure but during my two hours' stay, about half hours were spent take photos and signing autographs. Could have been nicer if I could spend more time admire the site quietly.The site itself is in the middle of the entire park and it's about 10 min walk from the entrance. There are different levels you have to climb. To spend about an hour or two at the temple itself would be about right. There are other places to visit inside the park but I didn't have time for all.

Buried in ash for hundreds of years before being re-discovered by Raffles a thousand years later.Quite magical, but also very crowded so get their early or late. Makes for better lighting for photos too, in the midday sun the light is very flat.The only other tip I have is that after (or before) visiting, go and have lunch at ""Plataran"" (its a hotel nearby). Plataran means patio or terrace, and that pretty much sums it up. It is a hotel restaurant with a beautiful terrace, with stunning views of Borobudur from a distance. And actually it helps to see it from afar, because up close it is hard to take in the size and scale of this temple.

In fact this is highly encouraged as each layer has different murals and carvings of Buddha and his disciples so there’s plenty to see.  The compound was once entirely covered in volcanic ash after an eruption (quite mind-boggling the amount of ash that must have been spewed over the area).  Borobodur hence remained hidden for more than a thousand years until its rediscovery by Sir Stamford Raffles (also the founder of Singapore in 1814).  There are about ten layers to ascend, and the carvings and decorations get increasingly sparse with each successive layer, in keeping with the Buddhist philosophy that Man cannot envision what the higher levels of Buddhist cosmology would look like.  Elaborate statues and murals cover the lower layers, while stupas (bell-like structures) are nestled up top.  Do pay for a guide as he’d be able to explain what the carvings mean.I would have loved to view Borobodur from a vantage point at the nearby mountains during sunset.  Unfortunately our itinerary did not allow this but I heard from friends this is beautiful.  Otherwise, go during the early morning to avoid the midday heat.  The sun was so strong by the time we reached the top that we could barely open our eyes due to the glare.One thing to note is that Borobodur can get crowded.  Yogyakarta is a student town so we had bus-loads of noisy schoolchildren, which – along with tourists – meant that there was often a jam on the staircases leading to the top.  It can also be difficult to get a clear spot for photo-taking.  The kids are very friendly, albeit a tad rowdy as per all teenagers, and some may approach you for a photo.  We were happy to oblige.At the end you’re made to weave through a market of sorts selling tourist paraphernalia.  Nothing very interesting so just make your way through quickly before the peddlers start buzzing around you.Bring bottled water (and some snacks if you like) cos there are no vendors along the way once you enter (which is the way it should be, as otherwise I’d imagine the vendors would spoil the views).  And be sure to go to the toilet beforehand – there are toilets in the compound but they are some distance away from the Borobodur structure itself.  Fairly clean, and you have to pay a very small fee.  Do also spend some time exploring the nearby gardens; they are well kept and you get lovely views of Borobudur from different angles.",2014-01-09,Family,2013-02,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882
Singapore,5.0,"The sunrise tour is worth waking up early up, we left the hotel at 3.30am to get to the Borobudur Temple at Magelang at 4.15am, along the way, our driver was caught speeding and beating the red-light, he was fined Rp 50,000 (US$5), which we pay for as it is not fair on the driver as we to leave at 3am but we left half hour late. Anyway, when we go to the hotel in the park (I forgot the name of the hotel), there was already a line of tourists paying for the entrance fee.Anyway, we wait for our guide to pay and off we went with torchlights in our hands and sarong around our waist, as a mark of respect though it is a ruins.The guide was great, his name is Jean Sridar (he is a local Indonesian with a Christian name), as we walked, he was giving us a short narration of the temple, and when we got to the top, which was only a short walk as the hotel was right next to the temple, he advised us on where is the best seat to watch the sunrise, we were sitting there enjoying the quiet and serenity, when a group of Asians (I am not looking down on my kind), but they were so loud in this peaceful environment, and it is so sad that they were speaking so loudly when it is so quiet, I figure them to be from China.Anyway, the sunrise was awesome, with redness in the sky, as it was an artist painting his canvass, in the foreground, the fog was lifting from the trees, and the two volcanos - one of them is Merapi, smoking lightly into the sky, is is a good sight for us city folks to see nature.After the wonderful sunrise, we had the opportunity to learn more about the ruins and also took a lot of photographs and by 6.30am, there was hordes of tourists starting to descend onto the temple, so it was about time of us to leave, we both enjoyed the temple and would recommend it to all.....",2013-12-30,Couples,2013-12,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"This is a severely under-rated attraction from overseas, hopefully more could be done to attract more people from overseas to see this temple!Went there during rainy season. Was debating whether to pay for the exorbitant additional fees to see the sunrise at the temple or to view sunrise from a nearby hill (Punthuk Setembu) with the whole Borobudor in the background. In the end, decided to go with the latter as the entrance fees are only 10% of what you pay for sunrise viewing at the Borobudor temple. In addition, there is no guarantee to see the sun rising there during rainy season, unless you don't mind seeing sunlight behind the clouds, which also have its own unique beauty. I rented a car with driver to go to Punthuk Setembu. Need to hike for 10 to 15 minutes before reaching the viewing point. Luckily it did not rain, or it will be difficult to walk on the muddy path. It was a different kind of beauty up there with Borobudor immersed in a sea of clouds, just breathtaking!Thereafter went to Borobudor around 6am. Try to visit the temple earlier before the mass exodus of students around 7am, even on a weekday like Monday! It is also very important to engage a guide (think about IDR 75k) who not only deciphers the reliefs on the walls but also shows/guides you the best places or ways to take your pictures!Don't rush all the way up the the top level like what most local tourists and students do over there. The best reliefs are from 1st to 3rd/4th levels.  Overall, I had a great time exploring Borobudor, perferring it to Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Maybe because Angkor Wat is a cluster a temples while Borobudor is just one on its own and makes it more manageable for me to explore and focus.",2013-12-26,Friends,2013-12,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992

"Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan, Malaysia",5.0,"This complex has the most complete stories of Prince Siddhartha in all the world. Many tourists will not be able to understand the meaning of this temple unless they have hired a tourguide. The carvings and sculptures would just become meaningless without the tourguide deciphering the message behind each carving and sculptures. Whether you are a Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, there are many valuable stories and teachings carved 360 degrees of this building that any religion can relate to. And these, can't be compared to Angkor Wat and Ta Phrom in Siem Reap. Angkor Wat is built for a King and Ta Phrom for a Queen. This is for religion purposes. Fatah was my tourguide and I'm super glad that I hired him. He was so knowledgeable about the place and told me many many stories about the carvings, the discovery of the place, the water system of the complex, why the bricks on the floor is built like legos etc. I asked him all sorts of questions and in every single question he is able to answer them.

"Cambridge, MA",5.0,"Borobudur needs no introduction, and to grade it like a schoolboy's project would be bizarrely inappropriate.  But, based on my recent visit, I would make the following specific recommendations that, as far as I have seen, have not (recently) been given here:1) If staying in Yogya and if you're up for it, take a scooter, i.e. have your guide(s) drive you there while you sit on the back seat.  Two reasons for this: Scooters are the vehicle of choice on Java, and you see the landscape, the surroundings, the villages, the rice fields and canals, the Merapi views, etc. much more intensively, indeed incomparably so.  Of course, the down side may be that this is not half as safe as a car (you are not allowed to hug your driver as you would do in Northern Europe - it's just not the custom, but you will get a helmet), that it is no pleasure in the rain, and that it's quite a long way if you are not used to it; you will feel various body parts very strongly after your return.  Still, I wouldn't have missed this for anything, especially going the small lanes and paths through the countryside.2) Sunrise is a bit early to get up, and it is a hassle the way it is set up (through the hotel or via bribes); day visits can get very hot and very crowded.  Try the ""compromise"" of an early morning visit, i.e. aim at arriving at or a little bit later than 6 pm.  The trip itself is great because of the changing light, it is still nice and cool(ish), there are much smaller crowds (don't ever expect no crowds - these pictures are fake; this is not a mediative site but the biggest tourist attraction of the 4th largest country in the world), and you still get the misty hills panoramas etc.3) Only local certified guides might show you around; the fee is something like €5.  It is actually up to you if you hire one.  The place is intuitive, i.e. you can go by yourself, and the little space you can create for yourself will be bigger when you don't have someone narrating the contents of the reliefs on the lower level.  On the other hand, good guides are easily able to lead you to the less-crowded stairs, vistas, and places, and they are very well informed.  Altogether, on balance, I would recommend a guide.4) Do visit the small Merapi temple (separate review section here, but it's invariable a stop on the way to or from Borobudur); it is charming, calm, older, and if you are into the typical Borobudur souvenirs such as mini statues, they are significantly cheaper here (if still overpriced, even at 50%, but that's the nature of souvenirs).  Borobudur is not a ""must"" visit, as nothing is, you can visit whatever you want - but it is a great place, very impressive, very beautiful, well-maintained and worth every effort to go to.",2013-12-09,Friends,2013-12,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882

Find a parking lot is easy, but the access to the parking area was very crowded. Not only cars and motorcycles, there also horse-chart, ""becak"", and of course people crowd. Borobudur is the largest Buddist temple. To reach the temple area, you need to walk about a hundred metre (I'm not sure about the distance, sorry) from the entrance gate. Otherwise you can ride a pay-train to get there faster and easy. The temple is stunning, with the mountain-view background. Fresh air and cooler weather compare to Jakarta of course :-) as there are many vegetations here. But if you travel with children, better bring umbrella or hat. They will be useful in the temple area. The temple has more than 500 stupas, some of are not in good condition. However this complex offers a magnicifent site, considering it was built in the Syailendra Dynasty and older than Angkor Wat. Each terrace of Borobudur symbolizes the stage of human life through the relief that engraved along the stone wall.Not only temple, you can also visit the Borobudur Museum in the same location. So bad, they already closed when I came back from the temple. Souvenir shops are easy to find, just be ready to bargain. The restrooms are available outside the entrance gate, and they just renovated recently. The temple is worth to be visited when you go to the Yogyakarta or Magelang. For me, the ticket price still reasonable for both local and foreigner. Do not visit on public and school holidays, so you can avoid the crowd and take great pictures of this temple.

You can see Merapi volcano and Mt Merbabu from Borobudur. Spiritual enthusiasts can actually meditate there and take in the mythical atmosphere (provided you don't have too many tourists). A must-visit.Now here's where I must tell you about the logistics:1. Best time to go for the view is sunrise (5.30am) or sunset (5.30pm). Sunrise is much cooling but you cannot access the temple site except via Manohara resort entrance (and they charge a fee). If you can find the isolated entrance at the back of the hill, you can try bribe the temple guards with Western cigarettes (which they highly value) to let you in for sunrise. Going there for sunset poses less logistical problems although it may be a little hot.2. If you choose to go via Manohara resort for sunrise, you will have to pay the resort at the receptionist for the entrance fee. You will notice that other hotels charge more like extra 10k rupiah or so, for example Saraswati where I stayed. My advice is that it is better for you to go through your own hotel (who will arrange with Manohara to let you in) because despite lower fee for hotel guests, Manohara rooms are very expensive so in the end you pay more to stay there and visit Borobudur, than to stay in cheaper place and pay (slightly) higher fee via Manohara entrance.You only need 1 to 2 hours. Or longer if you're camping for sunrise/sunset. You won't regret it.",2013-12-03,Couples,2013-11,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992

"Hua Hin, Thailand",5.0,"Traveling to Borobudur is not easy. The Magelang city is just a small, calm place with life going in much slower pace than in Bali where I have stayed. I flew with Airasia to Yogyakarta and than took a taxi to Joga bus station and took a mini bus (CEMARA TUNGGAL) to Borobudur. Mini bus is fun. Rides with opened doors, giving you nice shake on bumped roads. I enjoyed the ride and took some great pictures on the way through opened doors. I stayed there for 2 nights in fantastic Seraswati Hotel. I wanted to experience the sunrise so I gave weather a chance (November is half- raining season, it rains every day but not all day, just half a day). I was lucky first morning... being there at sunrise and sharing the moment with other tourists was really magical. Later that day I rented a bike and just went around to see the temple from a distance surrounded by some beautiful rice fields and small villages.

kuala lumpur,4.0,"This is a definitely must-see list.  Personally, I think the only reason why a person is travelling to Yogyakarta is to see this UNESCO site.  Without the Borobudur temple, the city will have no attractions at all.Ticket price is 190,000 Rp per person and if you need a guide, it will cost Rp75,000 (for 1 - 4 pax).  I will advise you to take a guide.  After all, you are already there and without the guide, you will not know the significance of the carvings and the story of Buddha.  The guide was very knowledgeable.  It was unfortunate that our visit clashed with a class trip and the students who rather disrespectful of the place and was shouting and screaming and sitting on the structure which is not allowed.  Kids will be kids but I blamed the teachers for not explaining to them and proper behaviour when visiting a sacred place.We then spent some time to explore the place on our own.  There is a museum (price included in the entrance fee). You will see what the place looked like prior to restoration.  Big difference.

Back then, you could practically park in front of Borobudur and, while on Borobudur itself, vendors hawked their products in a very aggressive manner. Also, back then, it was common to see students climbing all over the different statues and structures that make Borobudur unique.  Wow... has Borobudur changed in since 2000.  Fortunately, Borobudur became a Unesco World Heritage site.  This meant, standards were put in place to better protect the ancient temple.  Now, parking is roughly a half mile walk through lush gardens to protect the site from vehicle exhaust.  There are no vendors on the temple grounds nor are there vendors between the main entrance and the walk to the temple.  If anyone dares to climb on statues or on other structures they are quickly scolded by the security guards.  Big improvements from 13 years ago.  And, the temple itself?  Absolutely amazing!

I highly advice you take this up because having someone go from levels 1-6 telling you the stories of the carvings in a clockwise direction is literally priceless.Third tip is when you head over, peddlers selling you goods telling you ""Maybe you buy from me later, my name is Oscar/Eddie""; if you aren't interested in their wares just tell them no later. They will be waiting at the exit for the (seemingly long) walk back to your vehicles telling you that you ""promised them later"". However if you're interested in items, consult with your guide before exiting and asking for a fair price. The guide we took told us the peddlers will open bargaining at 250-300k rupiah but we should settle at 30k rupiah. Yeap 10% of their opening prices for souvenirs!Now for the temple visit itself in brief is how it tells the story of the birth of Buddha and how he went from baby to King to Buddha. If you get a good guide you will learn all you need to know about the inscriptions, the history of Borobudur how it was buried, restored, strengthened etc and when you reach the top the view is amazing.

"Monterrey, Mexico",4.0,"Yes, Borobudur (B) and Prambanan (P) are not next to each other but are easily seen in one day, and there are a couple sights in between them as well. Some advice has you up at 0400 so you can be at B to see the sunrise and beat the crowds, but who wants to be up that early on vacation? An Australian couple I met did that and, the way they described it, there were as many people there for their tour as I had there in the later morning; your choice. To see both/all you do need to leave in the morning, the best way is to reserve a car/driver for six hours (you can pay extra for additional hours if need be). I did so right at my hotel's concierge desk (Hotel Tentrem) and most hotels in Jogjakarta have similar availability. Head to B first, enjoying the miles of bas-relief on all the levels of this amazing site. As I had done my own research in advance and had some literature with me I avoided what seemed to be slow, plodding guided tours. After leaving B we saw a couple of small sites nearby, both definitely worth the stops, and then had the drive to the Hindu temple of P. While a great deal of it was knocked down in a 2006 earthquake, it is still quite an amazing site. I also researched and had literature on me and so could go right in and see the complex, once again avoiding the dull-seeming and slow tours. If you would like there are smaller temple complexes in the P area after you are done. B is definitely the one out of them all to see if you are pinched for time, but all can make a great day together.

I would recommend the sunrise tour not only for the stunning views of the rising sun but for those Buddhists who intend to do puja or practise a bit of meditation up there on the top, as the general atmosphere is quiet and most conducive when the crowd has yet to arrive. A good tip for students, is to bring along your student card to get a significant discount on the entrance fees. Another tip is to avoid visiting during the Rainy season and Wesak festival time in May as it can be very crowded. The best time is during the Muslim Fasting (Ramadhan) Month cos we did that and there was no crowd but the sunrise tour price does not include the services of a tour guide at that time.

Lots of relief panels to look at when you're on the way up, most of them restored so you can see the cracks or missing pieces here and there.

I spent at least two hours admiring the reliefs of the 3 levels and enjoying the view from the last one - a platform with 72 small stupas, each one containing a buddha and the monumental central one. Then I visited the museums - archeology and maritime.

"Seattle, WA",1.0,"Sorry, but this temple was not worth the trip at all.  They have everything tightly locked down to where you barely get to do anything except climb a myriad of 2-ft tall dangerous stairs with insufficient hand railing, and bake in the sun.  You're not allowed to sit or lean on anything without the cops yelling at you, so the photo ops go out the door right away.  Your only real photo options are the paid ones.Speaking of paying, this place is just a money pit of peddlers and beggars on the way to and from the temple.  You'll be pushing your way through peddlers trying to sell you from the moment you step out of your car, and wading through piles of pointless garbage on the way out.  It's really bad and sullies any interest I may have had before going to the temple.Honestly, if I'd have been left alone BEFORE we even walked to the temple, I might have held SOME interest in the temple itself, but by the time I even got to the ticket counter, I was already annoyed beyond comparison...This is not an exaggeration at all:  We pulled the car up, and before we even put the gear into park, we were immediately surrounded by crap-peddlers trying to sell us things that didn't even have anything to do with Borobudur temple: Bracelets, hats, kids toys, etc.  About the only useful thing was the sun-umbrella rentals. The other peddlers followed us almost all the way to the ticketing place, but stopped short before the large pile of junk shops that stood as a barrier prior to being able to even buy tickets.  Finally, once we were burned and exhausted, we had to go through their exit setup that's actually larger and worse then the entrance drudge.  First, you're ushered down a small walkway FULL of peddlers begging you to buy junk and following you all the way to the end of the walkway.  Then you go through a ""gate"" of sorts into their shopping maze that's about a 1 mile walk of junk stores and a few actual meaningful souvenirs...again, unfortunately, by then we were so tired of being harassed we didn't even want a real souvenir.  We just wanted to get to the car and leave - BUT doing so meant we also had to go back through the same peddlers who were waiting right there by our car for our return.  And once again, they huddled around the car like zombies until we finally left.Ultimately, they took something that could have been mildly interesting as far as temples go, and turned it into a tacky, greed-filled mess.  Oh, and by the way, you can expect the typical ""bule"" price-gouging since Indonesian citizens only pay $3 ea., but they have the nerve to charge $20 per foreigner.

For a full tour, you need to secure your own freelance guide, many of whom are available at the foot of the stairs. Later, you get complimentary tea, fried bananas, and a surprisingly nice gift. A few tips:1) You do not need to be booked at the Manohara Hotel to enter early. You just need to pay the early entrance fee.2) Sunrise wasn't packed with throngs of tourists, but you won't be alone.3) The sun rises from the East, but look also in other directions.4) Watch the sunrise alone and find a guide after to walk you through the temple.5) Read a synopsis of Siddhartha/Buddha's life before your visit to make more sense of the story in the panels.",2013-09-13,Couples,2013-09,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882

It looks good in photos, though its not necessary - other people may not have known about it.There are a couple of entrances, but I like the main one, because from the top, you can look back and see the line of tourists also taking the path you had just walked up from.If you have time, go back also for an afternoon check of the premises (can be done if you are staying at Manohara Hotel, as it gives its guests unlimited access of the temple during normal opening hours - its part of the check-in rates you pay). I think it would also look stunning in the afternoon sunlight.There are probably more than 2000 relief panels, and it would be a treat checking some of the more interesting ones if you have a knowledgeable guide. The con aspect of this, is that below the temple, there will be hawkers who will persistently be selling some items related to Borobodur - whether they be books, carvings or some such, and its hard to shake them off.Still though, its not enough to regret the experience of visiting this and emoting ala Lara Croft poses with the temple walls behind you...",2013-09-04,Friends,2013-08,philippines,12.7503486,122.7312101

"Manila, Philippines",5.0,"Borobudur is impressive! First, the location is so isolated, in the middle of a lonely tree-filled valley with hills on several sides. Second, although just one temple, unlike Cambodia's Siem Reap which has Angkor Thom, Ta Phrom, and Angkor Wat, the temple is indeed a work of art. It's really made up of two sections - the lower section contains all the thousand or so wall reliefs - and the figures are remarkably more detailed than those at Angkor - that supposedly ""schooled"" the monks and regular devotees in the life and times of Siddharta-Gautama Buddha (no one read or wrote back then so it had to be pictures or reliefs) as well as on the way to enlightenment. While the upper section contained the four tiers of stupas - 32 in a ring at the lowest level, 24 in the higher level, 16 in the second to the highest, and the grand stupa at the highest level. And each of those stupas (shaped like bells) hid a buddha statue inside, with the government kind enough to open two of them to the public so that you knew exactly what were in the other stupas. The Borobudur temple is very well maintained, with trash cans everywhere and tourist police ensuring that planned or accidental vandalism as well as horse play was eliminated.If you can avoid the weekend, that would be great since the locals do check out the place on weekends.

We tried to go for sunrise, but i'm not sure you can do this on your own.  The ticket gates for the public weren't open, I heard you have to book with an agent to get special access for sunrise.  It is really important to go early (before 10am) or late (after 3:30).  It's beautiful and clear in the morning, and you get great views of two nearby volcanoes.  By 11am, hordes of tour buses come in and it gets too crowded, plus it gets really hot during the middle of the day, and the photos aren't so good as the light and haze midday ruin the view.  If you go on the weekend, you'll see lots school bus local kids/tourists, they may ask you questions (part of their assignment to practice their English-it's not a scam) and even ask to take a picture with you as you are taking photos of the temple!",2013-08-25,Friends,2013-04,indonesia,-2.4833826,117.8902853

The price difference is only adult/senior or child.Everywhere you go in Indonesia (especially in Bali), non domestic tourist price is always so ripped off. The trick is, ask your Indonesian driver/tour guide to buy the ticket.Tell him that you want local price.

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"Most travellers who visit Java woud list this sight as 1 of the must-sees.  It was also my focus of my trip in early Jul 2013.I am sharing some tips below based on my experience :- It is best to stay near the temple rather than making it a day trip for Jogja/Solo.  Pick 1 of the hotels near the temple and stay 1 night.  It's worth it as it allows you to enjoy the temple at leisurely pace. The top choice would be Princess Manhohara Resort, located next to the temple.  Hotel guests enter free from 6am to 5:15pm via a private gate.  The hotel is decent and room rates are OK.  Though it may not be the cheapest and most comfortable one you can find, but the location and free access more than outweigh its minor shortcomings.- It's best to allocate 3 hours to see the sight, admire how it has been restored to its current state. It's simply amazing.  I encourage all visitos to engage tour guide at the temple ground so that you can fully appreciate this world heritage sight.  Fees are 75k Rp + tips (from 20k Rp, it's up to you).  For Manohara Hotel guests, you can watch the 30min Borobudur documentary movie in the comfort of your room before you make your visit.  Request the hotel receptionist to call for a guide as they are stationed at the public entrance, different from where you enter the temple compound. - Visitors are advised to enter from the east gate, start from the lowest level, proceed upwards in clockwise direction.  This way, you can understand the stories depicted on the relief properly. - It is recommended to do 2 trips, 1 during sunset, another during sunrise.  If you want to pick only 1 of them, choose sunrise, it's very beautiful and would cetrainly become the highlight of your trip. There will be far fewer visitors at that hour and weather is not hot.- To visit the temple for sunrise, skip the so-called sunrise tour, IMO it is a sales gimmick, with the hefty entrance fee you pay (230k Rp at time of my visit, also apply to Manohara hotel guests), you are brought into the temple compound at 4:30am, then you wait up on the top level of the temple till past 6am when sun rises. What you can do is just enter the temple compound when the access is opened at 6am (ie free for Manohara hotel guests, other visitors pay normal entrance fee which is 190k Rp at time of my visit.  You can check with your driver/tour company if they offer discounted tickets).  When I was there, there was sufficient time to make our way up to catch sunrise ~6:10am.  This way, you save cost and more importantly you don't need to sacrifice your sleep unnecessarily.- For those arriving from Jogja to Borobudur, it's ~1.5hr drive. Enroute, you can also stop by the 2 'sister temples of Borobudur' Mendut and Pawon Temples for quick look around. Admission is cheap, it covers 2 temples.- There is a museum located quite a distance away from the temple entrance.  You don't miss much if you skip it.- There is a tram service you can use, you pay 7.5k Rp per person to see the temple compound, IMO not worth the wait and cost.- Touts selling souvenirs in the way in and out the temple are very persistent.  Bargain hard if you are buying from them.Enjoy Borobudur!",2013-07-21,Family,2013-07,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992
"Osnabrück, Germany",4.0,"Waking up at 3am to drive for an hour and climb up those steps to witness the sunrise at Borobudur Temple is totally worth the effort! Downside: too many tourists it is almost impossible to take a decent picture of the serene place! You just gotta have some thick skin and ask people to move away so you can capture a great moment. I was asked to move a couple of times. :)We didn't stay in Manohara Hotel so we had to arrange our own transport to get there - we got an SUV and a driver for 300k IDR for pick up and drop off at our hotel (fit as many people you can fit in the car and divide the cost evenly, comes out pretty cheap!) and then we had to buy tickets to enter the temple at Manohara Hotel which was 380k per person which comes with a batik souvenir and light refreshments (tea/coffee with local delicacies). Make sure you get a tour guide so you understand the stories and beliefs of the temple - this comes with the entrance fee as well. For ladies, try and touch the Buddha's toes and make a wish. As for men, try and touch the Buddha's fingers - it is believed that your wish will come true. Doesn't hurt to try! :)",2013-07-21,Friends,2013-07,germany,51.1638175,10.4478313
"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",5.0,"Borobudur, a Buddhist temple built in the 9th century during the Sailendra Dynasty is one of the world’s greatest ancient monument and is also the single most popular tourist attraction in Indonesia today. It has been declared as a Unesco World Heritage Site and in June 2012 was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest Buddhist archaeological site in the world.It is situated in Magelang district of Central Java which is about 40 km or about an hour’s drive from Yogyakarta. Most tourists would also want to visit Prambanan Temple as well and so our tickets were purchased by our driver/guide at an office at a rest area somewhere along the road to Borobudur, so as to avoid the long queue at the entrance proper. The entrance fees for Borobudur is IDR190,000 per person and for Prambanan it is IDR171,000. After purchasing the tickets, we proceeded to Borobudur which was a short drive away.Foreigners enter the temple grounds through a separate entrance housed in a small building which has a ticket counter as well as a garden area with washrooms, on the outside. Here we had hot drinks and also cold bottled mineral water from a chiller at our disposal and many of the travellers would grab an extra bottle or two as spares, all complimentary and at no extra charge. Then before entering the temple compounds everyone was given a piece of batik sash to wear from waist down with a little assistance from the employees there, and as I somehow noticed later, the local visitors were wearing sashes of a different batik design, perhaps for identification purposes..The whole structure of Borobudur was so colossal and celestial that all we could do was to gaze in profound amazement as we approached the temple complex.It is very hard to imagine the complexity of the architecture of this amazing ancient Buddhist temple unless you are there to see it for yourself. There were thousands of panels of reliefs carved in stone depicting the many teachings and stories of yore, and numerous statues of Lord Buddha and stupas positioned in some mystical pattern besides sculptures of lions flanking arches and pathways. Even the balustrades and banisters were not spared the unique artwork of that era.The whole structure was built up of six concentric square platforms from a square base and topped by three circular platforms and crowned with a giant stupa centrally positioned at its topmost level and surrounded in a circular formation by numerous stupas and statues of the Buddha.The entire structure of the temple complex had been constructed by using huge blocks and slabs of black volcanic stones stacked on top of each other with fantastic precision to render its superb stability even at that enormous mass and height.The perforated stupas were skilfully designed too and even the floors of the pathways on every level had interlocking slabs to lend permanent strength to the entire structure of Borobudur. Just amazing.Being the top tourist attraction in Indonesia, Borobudur is a definite must-see, at least once in one’s lifetime in order to be able to truly appreciate its amazing architecture and splendour.",2013-07-15,Couples,2013-05,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823

"Seoul, South Korea",5.0,"It was a breathtaking view when we reached the top of Borobudur Temple! Each level represents a different stage of life, ranging from desire to the highest level of nirvana. When I reached the UNESCO World Heritage Site, I was stunned by its architecture. No cement was used for the wall to be built, and yet, it can still stand upright. The carvings on the wall represents Buddha's life and teachings. The stupas (at the top few levels) are shaped like the Buddha's hair.

"Kuching, Malaysia",5.0,"We went to Borobudur to coincide with Waisak 2013. When we arrived, we stayed at Saraswati Hotel as during this festive time, Manohara is only for Sanghas (monks and nuns) to stay. Sarawasti is about 10 minutes walk to Candi Borobudur. We hired bicycles from across the road from our hotel, for Rp15000 for half a day, rode to Candi Mendut and nearby areas, registered as ""perserta"" (participants) for Waisak. On Waisak day, chanting and rituals start at Candi Mendut in the morning and at lunch time walk the 6kms to Candi Borobudur. Only ""perserta"" are allowed into Borobudur free on this day. If you are not participating, you will have to pay Rp190000 for entry to Candi Borobudur. There was a brass band that led the procession. So many buddhist devotees walk behind the Sanghas. Buddhist monks and nuns of different traditions, the Vijrayana, Mayahana and Theravada led the crowd. By the night time, there were so many people in Candi Borobudur. Packed. Shoulder to shoulder. Beware of your pockets. I was holding on to my bag, felt my zip opened and indeed a guy tried to open my bag..was apprehended by my friend and we saw 4 ladies purses between his jeans and waist. So really have to be careful with belongings. Still, it was a wonderful experience. Releasing the ""lampions"" (lanterns) was magical..1000 of them.. A wonderful sight, never to be forgotten!

"Melbourne, Australia",5.0,"I went to Borobudur especially for the Buddhist Wesak Day celebrations at this magnificent ancient temple.  Usually the site is closed after sunset as there is no lighting for night access, but for Wesak Day celebrations  that last well into the night, temporary lighting is installed.  It was amazing to see Borobudur at night silhouetted against the sky.  About 3pm the rain started and didn't stop, finally at 10.30pm the releasing of the lanterns was cancelled due to the bad weather.  This was to be the highlight for many and I am sure a great disappointment for the monks who had travelled from all over the world for this celebration and the thousands of people who waited through the torrent of rain that fell for many hours.  The biggest disappointment, however, was having to wait for Indonesian politicians who arrived late, obviously with no concern for this religious festival or the thousands who were standing in the rain,  then proceeded to speak forever and then leave hastily as soon as their moment was over.  Politicians aside the calmness and patience of the audience, the chanting of the monks was very moving.

Our first visit was when we arrived around 2:30pm and I was in amazement at the sheer size of the temple, reading books and looking at photos just did not tell the story.There were people everywhere and we soon discovered that we were part of the main attractions. We had school children and adults wanting their photos taken with us  and in the end we had to say no as we were trying to enjoy the temple.The next morning we got up at 5:45am to be there first thing, as it was we got straight in before 6am as there was no one there and the gate was open, I ran from the bottom to the top to try to capture the last few seconds of the sunrise and thankfully I did not past out and I managed to see the sun just as it poked it head of the mountain. It was truly magical. To watch the temple and surounds change colours and moods as the sun rose was breathtaking and I must have taken hundreds of photos.The next morning we started at 4:30am, meeting in the lobby to be taken to the temple, we were at the temple, sitting and waiting before 5am, if you are not a photographer and do not mind if other people are in your way then sleep in a bit, the sun did not start to show any colour until after 5:30am.It was a little cloudy so it was no where near as vibrant as the postcard shots but I am sure it took them several visit attempts to get that one shot or a few hours on photoshop.We must have spent 3+ hours there each visit and I am sure you could spend more.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",5.0,"It is one of the most amazing historical sites I so far visited.The magnificent Borobudur temple is the world’s biggest Buddhist monument, an ancient site widely considered to be one of the world’s seven wonders. Built in the 9th century during the reign of the Syailendra dynasty, the temple’s design in Gupta architecture reflects India's influence on the region, yet there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian. This awe inspiring monument is truly a marvel. After a visit here we understood why it is Indonesia’s most visited tourist attraction and a famous icon of Indonesia’s cultural heritage.The location of the temple is approximately 100 km southwest of Semarang and 40 km northwest of Yogyakarta. The temple sits majestically on a hilltop overlooking lush green fields and distant hills. It covers an enormous area, measuring 123x123 meters. The monument is a marvel of design, decorated with 2,672 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues. The architecture and stonework was built without using any kind of cement or mortar! The structure is like a set of massive interlocking Lego blocks held together without any glue.The temple has remained strong even through ten centuries of neglect. It was rediscovered in 1815, buried under volcanic ash. In the 1970’s the Indonesian Government and UNESCO worked together to restore Borobudur to its former majesty The restoration took eight years to complete and today Borobudur is one of Indonesia and the world’s most valuable treasures.We stayed in Princess Manohara Resort nearby and our room's rate includes Borobudur entrance ticket during normal open time starting from 06.00 am to 17.00 pm (multiple entrances). Borobudur Sunrise Ticket (entrance at approximately 04.30 a.m.) is IDR 230.000 per person (+ afternoon tea included) while other guests who are not staying should pay IDR 380.000 per person. It was worth the money as we walked frequently to Borobudur from the hotel which is about 10 minutes.I booked the sunrise tour which started at 4.30am. A hotel staff walked us to the Borobudur site. This is the best time to explore Borobudur, before the crowds and in time to see the sun rise and the mist disappear. Unfortunately sunrise was not as exciting and spectacular as described in many brochures. It was pretty cloudy and the sun appeared for a short period of time… But atmosphere itself was amazing…The temple is decorated with stone carvings in bas-relief representing images from the life of Buddha. This monument is both a shrine to the Lord Buddha and a place for Buddhist pilgrimage. The ten levels of the temple symbolize the three divisions of the religion’s cosmic system. Like a book, Borobudur described ten levels of Bodhisattva which must pass to reach the perfection of the Buddha.As visitors begin their journey at the base of the temple, they make their way to the top of the monument through the three levels of Budhist cosmology, Kamadhatu (the world of desire), Rupadhatu (the world of forms) and Arupadhatu (the world of formlessness). As visitors walk to the top the monument guides the pilgrims past 1,460 narrative relief panels on the wall and the balustrades. The whole monument itself resembles a giant stupa, but seen from above it forms a mandala. The great stupa at the top of the temple sits 40 meters above the ground. The monument represents a Buddhist cosmological model of the universe organized around the axis of mythical Mt. Meru. Starting at the eastern gateway, pilgrims circumambulate the stupa, always in a clockwise direction. Walking through nearly five kilometers of open air corridors while ascending through six square terraces and three circular ones, the pilgrim symbolically spirals upward from the everyday world to the nirvanic state of absolute nothingness. The first six terraces are filled with richly decorated relief panels in which the sculptors have carved a textbook of Buddhist doctrines and a fascinating panorama of 9th century Javanese life. Upon the upper three terraces are 72 small stupas, each containing a statue of the Buddha (these statues are usually headless; relic hunters stole many of the heads, others are in museums). Crowning the entire structure is a great central stupa. Representing Nirvana, it is empty.This is a really amazing place that is certainly worth visit!!!",2013-05-26,Family,2013-01,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823
"Gladesville, Australia",5.0,"Many people like to hawk the brilliance of the Pyramids for its size & mysterious alignment to the stars, St Peters Cathedral for its shameful display of wealth or even the Statute of Liberty for its romantic notion of nationhood but those who have seen the brilliance of Borobudur will simply smile knowing they have seen awesome. After it was lost & forgotten in the jungle for a thousand years, Borobudur’s story resumed with its magnificent rediscovery by Europeans in modern times. Brick by brick, stone by stone UNESCO took apart the Borobudur’s millions of bricks & reassembled them to save it from crumbling into oblivion. The whole story will become a legend in itself & shows the ingenuity of not only modern engineers but the brilliance of the civilisation who originally built it. Fusing practical engineering with spiritual metaphysics to create this masterpiece, Borobudur once again stands at the centre of attention for its magnificence.The 1200 year old temple design is of a mandala, the Hindu/Buddhist geometric symbol of the universe. Designed as an instrument as much as a building, it was used to balance the mind via meditation. The geometric dimensions of the structure are hard to appreciate until it is seen from the air or in a miniaturised model form. The realisation at what you are looking at is inspiring & becomes clear that Borobudur is without doubt the greatest Buddhist temple ever to have been constructed. Not only was the complex designed with a rational architectural philosophy in mind, there was also a major spiritual & mechanical purpose. Ancient monks meditating here used Borobudur’s mandala structure to enter a trance where one could attempt to understand the ultimate truths of reality & the universe, much more than just a place to meet women. Nearby Mendut & Pawon temples lie within 3kms of Borobudur & are geographically positioned in a straight line to one another, the reason? lost a thousand years ago. A car & driver can be hired for the entire day from Yogyakarta for 400-600,000 IDR where it is easily possible to visit Borobudur in Magelang 43 kms away then return to the Prambanan complex 17kms from Yogyakarta. The best advice is to visit one of these for sunrise & the other at sunset, maximising the best of both worlds.",2013-05-23,Couples,2013-02,australia,-24.7761086,134.755

The ticket price was 190,000 IDR (approx $20 USD) and was worth every penny.  We would also recommend that you hire a tour guide from the foreign visitors building for IDR 75,000.  The tour guides speak fluent English as well as many other languages.  In addition to the price, it is normal practice to tip the tour guide as well (IDR 50,000 should be fine!); they will greatly appreciate it and certainly earn it!  Also in the visitor's center is free coffee and tea as well as ice cold bottles of water which you can take with you during your visit to the temple.The walk is long and the steps sometimes steep so we would recommend visiting in the morning or evening and not in the middle of the day when it will be quite hot and humid!When you enter and exit the temple area, there are also a large number of vendors who, while tremendously persistent, are also very friendly and eager to bargain!  If you truly are not interested in purchasing from the vendors, do not make any eye-contact with them or their products or else they will follow you all the way to the exit.

Not sure if we were plain unlucky or it is common for not getting sunrise (those planning for one might want to check more) as the next day when we were flying off, we found the sky to be as cloudy too.

"Pritchard, Canada",5.0,"My husband and I came to the Yogyakarta area primarily to visit Borobudur.  We weren't disappointed.  Although we missed sunrise, we still arrived just after 6:30 and spent several hours touring the temple and area.As a foreigner, the ticket price is hefty - 190,000 rupiah each.  That includes a cup of coffee or a bottle or water.  We paid another 75,000 rupiah for a guide which I definitely recommend.  You need a sarong but they will lend you one for the tour.  Use the toilet facilities before you head to the temple as there aren't any close by the temple and it is a long walk back.  Also the toilet facilities in the international visitors center where you pay are by far the nicest and cleanest toilets on the premises and are the only ones with toilet paper.The temple is impressive but the story behind the reconstruction of the temple is equally impressive.  We both found it very inspiring and thoroughly enjoyed our guide's explanation of the reconstruction, the subsequent damage from the 2006 earthquake and the 2010 volcano eruption and the on-going restoration.You may note that one of the Buddha's at the top has a large black bee on it.  I have attached a photo showing the bee on his head.  Amazingly, the bee will fly away for a minute or two but returns to the exact same place.  Apparently, the bee does this all day.  Evidently, there is always a bee there - this is an on-going event.  If you are interested in energy or are curious, this will fascinate you.  Ask your guide to show you the Buddha or look for it yourself.You can rush through the temple in about 90 minutes but for the money spent, and the magnificence of the temple, take your time and enjoy the experience.  There is a documentary film on the temple - as a foreigner, it is included in your ticket as is the train ride.There are tons of hawkers once you are outside the temple - they aren't allowed inside.  We got taken by one so shop carefully.  There didn't appear to be any decent food stalls or restaurants in the area.  We left the area to go have lunch.

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"i)	It is a matter of luck whether you get to see the beautiful sunrise or not because the weather changes minute to minute. But if its your lucky day, you will get to see the view of a lifetime. We went on our first wedding anniversary: the  crimson skies, sun slowly rising above the Merapi volcao, the gentle breeze and the peaceful quiet made it a really memorable dawn for us. Our guide said that the best sunrises are in April, but no one can say for sure. ii)  Borubudur is not a UNESCO Heritage site for nothing.The temple has 10 levels and 504 Buddha statues. The most fascinating part is that the stones that make up the temple are not cemented together only placed through interlocking and dovetailing. So the entire temple can be taken apart like a giant jigsaw puzzle and then put back together. That itself is worth a look.iii) From atop the temple, you see the Merapi volcano that last exploded in 2010 and is still spewing smoke.You also see the Merbabu mountain adjoining the Merapi. In April, the sun rises behind the Merapi, from May to August, it rises between the Merbabu and the Merapi.	iv)	 Staying at the Manohara resort within the Borubudur Campus is the most economical way to see the temple. Entrance fee only for Manohara guests is ($23.00) for multiple entries throughout the day. The hotel itself is not very expensive but don’t expect too much of the stay there. You also have to book well in advance since the rooms are in high demand.v) If you are NOT staying at the Manohara, the entrance fee is steep ($38.00 per person) for one-time entry. The entrance fee includes a free flashlight, a sarong (which you have to return at the end of the visit) and coffee and a snack at the end of the temple visit.vi) Its worth paying around Rp. 150,000 ($12- $15) to get a tour guide. The history behind the archaeological discovery of the monument and the story behind the sculptures is well worth hearing. We got a guide named Jamaal through the Manohara Resort who has also been a UNESCO volunteer  during the temple's restoration. A Muslim himself, his knowledge of Borobudur, and of  Buddhist and Hindu religious history in Java had us spellbound. vii)	On the way back from the temple to our resort (we stayed at the Plataran), we hired an andong (a local horse carriage ride). Riding through the villages was fun. Its surprising that a monument so SPECTACULAR should be so little known outside of Indonesia. Definitely deserves to be more in the spotlight.

"Beijing, China",5.0,"The temple itself is an amazing piece of architecture, and a must see if you happen to be around Java. The views from the temple top are amazing with mountains in the background on 3 sides and a magnificent view of the 2 volcanos on the east side. The condition of this archaeological site is very well kept though the stair railings made of S/S contrast loudly with the structure itself. A wooden railing if there is need for one would be more suited and in harmony with the structure.A guide is needed if the visitor is interested to understand the meaning of the sculptured tiers that make up the temple. these can be found at the entrance hall of the site at around 100,000Rp (US$12) for the visit. The admission ticket is 190,000Rp (US$21) which is fairly high for a single location. Unfortunately, to get the best of this place you only have 2 hours from 6AM-8AM after which truckloads of tourists are emptied into the place which hardly leave room to take a photo without obstruction of someone crossing in front of your camera.Overall this place is one of the 3 must see in Asia, the other two being Angkor in Cambodia and Bagan in Myanmar, though this one is on a much smaller footprint than the other two. Comparably, for the same money in Cambodia you have an additional 100 locations while in Bagan for the price of US$10 you have an unlimited number of days with over 1000 temples of various architectural value.",2013-04-17,Friends,2013-04,china,35.000074,104.999927

After all, I lived for 20 years in Indonesia and Yogyakarta and its surrounding temples of Borobudur and Prambenan are all delightful.Arrive at Borobudur before sunrise for the most wondrous experience, and, of course, to beat the heat. Buddhists have this thing about setting their temples and shrines in places where they catch the rising sun. Go to Bhutan, and see Tiger’s Nest for starters, or travel to Seam reap and experience the jaw dropping magic of Angkor Watt.How does Borobudur compare? It doesn’t. It can’t. There is no point in comparing.  You may say that in Cambodia you can visit hundreds of other temples nearby and that adds to the experience. Indeed you can, but the same can be said of Borobudur: consider the temples dotted over the fumarole dotted mystery of Dieng, or the incredible plains of Prambenan between Solo and Yogya. But in and of itself, the Borobudur Temple is worth the admission (round $20). You can spend hours wandering around its huge galleries. The stone carvings are a wonder.

The room rate is inclusive of 2 admission tickets to the temple (pretty worthwhile if you asked me!), which cost Rp.190,000 per ticket for foreigners. We'd decided not to go for the 'Sunrise Tour', which you had to pay an additional Rp.230,000. Instead, we took the advice of the staff at the reception & left our rooms at 6am when it was still cool & it hadn't begun to get crowded. Took us about 3 minutes to get to the entrance gate, from which we could already see the temple which look absolutely magnificent, & we quickly made our way through the footpath towards it, got there, looked at it & just gawked! Against the warm glow of the morning sun.. oh, just so, so gorgeous!Once we'd finished gawking, we just went rather crazy snapping photos - everything seemed photo worthy! Other than saying that the temple is beautiful, the carvings are beautiful, the statues are beautiful, the stupas are beautiful & that it's such a visual treat, I shan't go into details as I strongly believe the you just need to be there to see & experience it for yourself! I shall, however, post some photo to get a glimpse of what I mean by beautiful.Going in the morning is also great as you get to see the mist lifting ftom the mountains in a distance & the vegetation looks all lush & green from the morning dew. So nice! Exploring the temple, snapping photos & taking all in will take about 1.5 - 2 hours. Do try & come as early as possible (the temple is opened from 6am - 5pm) in the morning as it's cooler but do also bring along a hat/cap but probably an umbrella would be most practical as it can be used for both sun AND rain (there's no shade at the temple if it rains), sunblock as by 8am it'll start to get hot & drinking water.Visit!

Malaysia,5.0,"Visited late March 2013 on a public holiday weekend. The distance from Yogyakarta is 47km but don't be deceived. It took us almost 2 hours to get there! We were in the vicinity the day before but because it started to rain, we did not enter and returned the next day.Price, USD20, which includes water, coffee/tea at the International Visitors ticketing office. It has a courtyard which you can sit around as well. Foreign visitors enter through a different entry point. we were told that if one paid slightly more for a sunset entrance ticket, you would get to stay for another extra hour after the official closing time. Perhaps this would be good for people wanting to do some serious photography.As our luck would have it, we visited during a long holiday weekend and it was shoulder to shoulder up the Temple. Difficult to take photographs in the crowd but the atmosphere of the place was electrifying. It would have been nice if there was no one but the crowd added to the atmosphere. We enjoyed it. School kids from Solo kept approaching us to practice their English, taking notes and videotaping the 'interview' session and all. We had fun. Apparently, we were told that 90% of the visitors here are Indonesians. It is so good to see the country's own nationals visit this as part of their National heritage.Official personal guides are available at Rp75,000 (just under USD8) for about 1 hour of guided tour. Well worth our money. The guide led us from part to part and told us where are the best positions to take photos. He knew we were quite keen with taking photos and always offered to take our photos at strategic places. he would also tell us little facts, statistics, dates, etc, etc. - never boring. He would say, 'this is the best place to take photos of the mural as other parts after this will not be as nice anymore', etc. When it started to rain when we were half way up the Temple, he went looking for umbrellas for us and never for once rushed through the tour. Walk three rounds the top level and make a 'non-materialistic' wish, he said at the end.Be prepared to walk as we were told that a complete walk of the Temple was about 4-5 km. The Temple was big and as you turned to face it at the end of a long walkway, it was a big WOW. It was simply fantastic! I just cannot imagine anybody who will not be impressed by this structure and the history behind it.Tips: (1) Go early or late. The afternoon sun was a killer; (2) The, it started to rain and there was nowhere to take shelter at all once you are on the structure. And it started to pour suddenly. If at all, there is any hint of rain, just rent an umbrella from any umbrella vendor as you enter the monument (Rp5,000 only). You return it as you exit. (3) Have good walking shoes and be prepared to walk. There is still a very long distance to walk after you exit the main monument area. (4) the best photo opportunity of the entire Temple complex is from the West side (it is clearly marked) at the level one. From here, one can shoot the entire temple with no obstruction with a wide angle lense. (5) Bring water and a change of T-shirt - you will be drenched either way, rain or shine.GIven the chance I would visit again. Just to wander around.",2013-04-01,Friends,2013-03,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823
USA,4.0,"Visiting Borobudur was an excellent experience. We took the early morning pre-sunrise entry package from Manohara hotel. The experience was really something. If you plan to go here, early morning is the best time to go. The morning mist and soft light enhances the experience in ways that day-time visit just wont do, but this comes at a price (see below). The views around were great too. I would have given it 5 stars except for the exorbitant prices charged by Manohara hotel for this. They call it a guided visit, but all the ""guide"" does is show you the way to the monument and I couldn't find him after that to ask any questions. The tea and snack included in the price is a gimmick at best.

At the bottom there were depictions of people doing good and getting good things in return and people doing bad and getting bad things in return. Then there were depictions of Budha's life. At the very top, there were no more depictions as you have reached Nevada and do not need any more symbolisms. Apparently at the very centre of the construction is a drainage system.

I would suggest to come for the sunrise tour @Rp230,000(Manohara Hotel guest price) or Rp330,000 (tourist not stayin at Manohara).The sunrise tour starts at 430am n its best you go in the temple as fast as possible to grab the best spot otherwise it will be filled with ppl blocking your view.After the sunrise,you can walk around exploring the temple..its great bcz at this hour the tour groups r not here yet so there isnt alot of ppl.One of the annoying thing here is the people who r trying to sell you souveniers upon exiting from the temple.

"New York City, NY",5.0,"We visited Borobudur while staying in Yogyakarta last year.  As all of the other reviews and photos can attest, its a really amazing place that is certainly worth a few hours.  Beyond the stunning temple itself, there are a few small museums on the property and guides available for hire (though we did not use one).  Like many Indonesian attractions, there is also a maze of food stands and souvenier shops near the parking area.  They will try to sell you all sorts of things, but were not too aggressive about it.The site is very large, so expect some walking.  To get to the top of the temple, there are several stories of stone steps as well.  The views from the top make it absolutely worth it.  You can also spend some time walking around the various levels of the temple to see the incredibly well preserved wall carvings.  I'd recommend bringing plenty of water and some comfortable shoes for your trip.One really interesting note if you are a Western visitor.  This site is very popular with school groups.  I am (a) fair skinned and (b) over six feet tall.  Unlike Bali that gets droves of international tourists, I got the distinct impression that I was a bit of an oddity to many of these students.

The craftsmanship and artistry is something I doubt we could achieve in these modern times so to think this monument was completed over 1100 years ago is mind boggling.  We stayed at the Monohara Hotel and got up early to catch the sunrise.  At IDR230,000 each for the Sunrise Package (which included a sarong, torch and early morning pass) it is not cheap and as we patiently waited for the sun to rise I was thinking that the sunrise thing was a little overrated.  But as the sun peaked behind the smoking Merapi volcanoe and cast its orange glow across the misty Kedu Plains, the expense and early morning start were suddenly all worthwhile.  The soft early morning light also make for some great photos of the temple.  I recall we spent about 4 hours at the temple before returning briefly to our hotel for breakfast, then back again to the temple.  By now the sun was up high so this time we spent more time examining the many thousands of reliefs in more detail.  So all up I think we spent 6 hours there and probably could have spent longer but by now the kids were a bit over it.  The only niggle about our visit was the many, many english students who were there on a study group outing to practise their english skills (where better to find native english speakers than the most popular tourist attraction in Indonesia!).

The predatory incompetence of the local kleptocracy's arrival and departure formalities  provide a shockingly bad first and last impression and a powerful insight into why Indonesia lags so pitifully behind its neighbors.

Upon landing in Yogyakarta, we immediately went to Borobudur for the afternoon.  It was a hour away from the airport.  As a World Heritage site, the park was developed well with a systematic way to enlist our guides, buy tickets and rest.  They also provide water, coffee and tea while preparing for the tour.  We went to the site after going through the routine including putting on a sarong.  The temple was amazing to look as we approached the site.  They have reconstructed the temple on the hill after discovering the site in the late 1890's.  The temple was a sight to behold particularly given the bricks were laid together without the benefit of mortars.We walked around and enjoyed the stories of our tour guide and the ornate carvings on the walls of the temple.  We decided to go to Nirvana (top of the temple) as it looked like it was going to rain.  The scenery from the top was beautiful as well.  We did not get a chance to go a deeper dive as it started raining quite heavily.  Fortunately, there were umbrellas for hire which we quickly got to protect ourselves for the rain.  We were glad we went back as the rain only got stronger with time.

The whole town is dusty, and we nearly didn't go up the temple because it was closed for cleaning.  If we stayed a few days later, we had to come back by charity/rescue air.  The lava is nothing, the hot air is the real killer.The Kraton or king's palace is filled with the history of Central jawa's batiks.  The outstanding parang pattern is meant for men.  At night, nearby the Kraton, there's a field with 2 Banyan trees.  The locals had this game of walking blindfolded in between the trees.  Sounds simple enough?  Not so.  We tried it and both of us went off tangent, astray from the trees.  I thought I walked in straight line, but somewhere halfway, my left foot dominates and I steered to the right.  It is symbolic of the path you have taken in life and if you have deveered from the original path.Taman Sari is the king's swimming pool.  Walking down from the entrance to the pool, there are stone huts where the musicians play the gamelan for the king and mistresses.  The pool has two compartments with a water fountain in the middle, stone steps to the pool, and an observation tower for the king to observe which one of his mistress is the best swimmer I supposed (haha).

For those who has asthma or weak legs, I suggest that you do not try to walk up as you can get breathless at times. There's no elevator except stairs for you to move on.

The history that it holds is also very interesting, so if at all possible get a guide to come with you.  The surroundings gave us a very peaceful and calming sensation.  It's really relaxing.  Be prepared to walk a bit as there are I think 5-6 levels but take your time climbing as the stairs are quite high but there are railings to hold onto.

"Toronto, Canada",5.0,"I don't think anyone could fully appreciate Borobodur unless one books the place for solo viewing.  It is as the pictures show and what others write about.  It is a massive complex (10,000 sq m by my mental calculation), full of stone reliefs (over 2,500), over a hundred stupas, a few hundred Buddhas (some headless), in 9 levels.  It is sheer awesome.  Seen from afar, up close and on top, I think's one of the most beautiful temples I've come across (that includes churches and pyramids).I was there during the Christmas week, and it was crowded.  I didn't leave Yogya early enough, and missed the sunrise at Borobodur.  I can just imagine what sunrise would be like at Borobodur, but I'm pretty sure there would be a crowd by then.  I read that one has to go around 9 times to the top, but it was a challenge to go through the crowds (mainly kids on school excrusions) and the no go through zones in some sections.  I did manage to go around 9 times, to the top. Surrounded by all these stupas (and people), one is rewarded by a sight of the crown (the main stupa) and the surrounding area.All I know about Borobodur is very sketchy.  It is a Buddhist temple, from the 9th century when Buddhism and Hinduism were predominant in Java.  Mt. Merapi an active volcano that has directly impacts the temple when it erupts, is supposed to be seen from the top, but which direction I couldn't tell.  Borobodur was re-discovered in early 1800's and what we see now is painful block by block rebuilding of the temple over 200 years. There are 2 museums in the park complex: one a museum devoted to the reconstruction of the temple (mostly photo exhibits), and the other is a ship museum, a recreation of the ""Borobodur"" ship from one of the reliefs.I was stopped 3 x on the way up by school kids wanting to practise English with rehearsed questions.  Then the obligatory photo op (I'm not blond by the way, more like receding hairline). The second time I sneaked in my own shot before they took mine with them.  So Kristian Paulus, you are now on Trip Advisor.To get there, the only (best) way for a foreign visitor is hire a taxi or a private car (between 250k-350k for 5 hours).  It is quick, saves you the hassle of getting on the small buses (20k? from the bus depot) which I did, and totally regretted.  It is 40 km from Yogya, around  1 hr or so by bus.  From the Magelang drop off, it's about 500 metres on foot or 7K rp.  On the return, I took the bus again, and at the Yogya bus depot, no taxi will ever use a metre.  I paid 70k rp to get back to my hotel (Grand Aston on Solo).  And don't get put off by the thousands of rupiahs.  10,000 rp is roughly USD 1.00 only.Borobodur is of course #1 recommended site to visit when in Yogya even with the crowd.

Of course, this is one of the top attractions in the world and the architecture and location are stunning.  Though, the way the temple is treated for the moment is a real shame...It starts already at the entrance...  There is a separate entrance for foreigners.  Foreigners pay 190000 Rupias (Indonesians 10000 Rupias) which is absolutely fine for such an attraction.  Though the entrance tickets for foreigners is one big scam !!!  You see the ticket, though you cannot keep the ticket.  Through a complicated system, they guide you into the temple compound and reuse the same ticket.  I wonder who gets better of this scam but the money is definitely not going to the temple protection and conservation....  Call it widely organized scam.once in the temple, people are climbing, scratching, touching, eating, etc all over the monument.  There are lots of security agents who all stand in a corner, playing with their mobile phone and having a good laugh among each other.  Tourists and visitors can do anything they like there.

"Singapore, Singapore",4.0,"Visited during the rainy season (sunrise and sunsets prone to overcast disappointments) and stayed at Manohara hotel on package from Angsa Tours, highly recommended. From hotel grounds it is possible to exit Jogja afternoon, visit at sunset (rushed since the park closes), overnight and slightly more leisurely at sunrise again, avoiding the heat of day (no shade!), and 5 minute walk to virtually a private entrance. Sarong from hotel, no gamut of hawkers, although some persistent & enterprising ones lie in wait at hotel entrance. Late afternoon first-look and happy snappy at the lower square levels with plenty of stories on the walls, jostling with school groups and other tourists (yes, leaning against the stupas in the upper circular levels and earning bullhorn warnings from security). Next day, did not take the 4.30am additional fee sunrise entrance as forecast was for rain, but was still able to snatch some moments of solitude before the crowds.

The tour guides at are hired at the entrance are largely very mechanical  in their explanation and uninspiring. There is only 1 way up and 1 way down and it is jam packed. I fear to imagine what will happen when there is an earthquake with thousands of people jamming one exit with unstable stones all around them....Anyway, not worth the high entrance fees. The sarong to be worn is not nforced for foreigners, which defeats the purpose of wearing sarong to show respect. The locals climb all over the stupas and touch all the carvings which again goes against the idea of preserving the heritage of the area if you allow people to slowly weather away all these artifacts.Will not visit due to high prices charged that is unjustified, poor organisation and poor staff training.",2012-12-24,Family,2012-12,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992

"Hyderabad, India",4.0,"The world famous temple of the Buddhist is Borobudur, which teaches us the way of life & path to heaven. very great art, solid volcanic rocks excellent ancient heritage. Borobudur, the Biggest Buddhist Temple in the Ninth Century was built by King Samaratungga, one of the kings of Old Mataram Kingdom, the descendant of Sailendra dynasty. Based on Kayumwungan inscription, an Indonesian named Hudaya Kandahjaya revealed that Borobudur was a place for praying that was completed to be built on 26 May 824, almost one hundred years from the time the construction was begun. The name of Borobudur, as some people say, means a mountain having terraces (budhara), while other says that Borobudur means monastery on the high place.Borobudur is constructed as a ten-terraces building. The height before being renovated was 42 meters and 34.5 meters after the renovation because the lowest level was used as supporting base. The first six terraces are in square form, two upper terraces are in circular form, and on top of them is the terrace where Buddha statue is located facing westward. Each terrace symbolizes the stage of human life. In line with of Buddha Mahayana, anyone who intends to reach the level of Buddha's must go through each of those life stages. The base of Borobudur, called Kamadhatu, symbolizes human being that are still bound by lust. The upper four stories are called Rupadhatu symbolizing human beings that have set themselves free from lust but are still bound to appearance and shape. On this terrace, Buddha effigies are placed in open space; while the other upper three terraces where Buddha effigies are confined in domes with wholes are called Arupadhatu, symbolizing human beings that have been free from lust, appearance and shape. The top part that is called Arupa symbolizes nirvana, where Buddha is residing.Each terrace has beautiful relief panels showing how skillful the sculptors were. In order to understand the sequence of the stories on the relief panels, you have to walk clockwise from the entrance of the temple. The relief panels tell the legendary story of Ramayana. Besides, there are relief panels describing the condition of the society by that time; for example, relief of farmers' activity reflecting the advance of agriculture system and relief of sailing boat representing the advance of navigation in Bergotta (Semarang).All relief panels in Borobudur temple reflect Buddha's teachings.

But really, the 2 hours allocated is enough.All the tour agents in Yogyakarta will provide an air-conditioned vehicle and a driver.  But they will not guide you through Borobudur.  You have to get an English-speaking guide there for (at the time of writing) Rp75,000.  For the price, it’s worth it.  The guide we had was quite knowledgeable.  He accompanies you for 1 hour, and you have the next hour traipsing through the site and taking all the photos you want.Most of the reliefs are in good condition and it’s not as difficult a climb than the temples at Angkor Wat.  There are steps of course but at each platform, it’s quite flat.  We saw people with stilettos – that’s just silly.It is hot in November and there is no toilet beyond the ticket office.

"London, UK",4.0,"My wife and I was staying at a great hotel nearby, Hotel Plataran Borobudur, and so we took their offer of a guided sunrise tour to the temple which is certainly the best way to see experience Borobudur, in my opinion.We left the hotel at 4.30am and arrived at the temple 5 minutes later. When we got inside the temple grounds, it was still quite dark which sets a great atmosphere for a well guided tour. Even at this early hour you do not have the temple for yourself, but you are still able to experience some solitude and take some good pictures without tourists in them, especially since everybody’s already sitting down and waiting for the sunset. I recommend you exploit this and take a walk around the temple and enjoy the morning mist over the jungle before the sun pops up.Borobudur is a large temple, but very flat and therefore difficult to fully grasp in my opinion. I think the best view of the temple is actually from the air, but with a good guide, which we had, you will discover an interesting history and display all along the walls of the temple and the location in the jungle can be exiting as well.The temple opens to the public at 6am and shortly after that the temple gets crowded. We had an opportunity to visit the temple again in the middle of the day, but the parking lot was so full of tourists and busses, that I do not imagine it being better than a sunrise visit.We took a guided tour offered by our hotel, so it was not cheap, but our guide and somewhat solitude experience was certainly worth it.",2012-11-06,Couples,2012-09,united kingdom,54.7023545,-3.2765753

,5.0,"Bodobudur is the largest buddhist monument in the world.  Measuring 123 meters x 123 meters, it features 504 Buddha statues, 2, 672 relief panels showing 1,460 intricate scenes carved out of the stone, telling the story of Buddha.  Bodobudur is topped by a giant bell 10 meters in diameter, which is surrounded by 72 perforated stupas, each with a buddha inside. .  Built by the Sailendra dynasty between 750 and 842 AD, it is 300 years older than Angkor Wat.  It is Indonesia's #1 tourist attraction, with 2.1 million visitors in 2011, and already 2.2 million as of 2012, but most of these are still domestic tourists, with foreign tourists numbering only about 166,000.Bodobudur is a must-see temple in Central Java, but if you're expecting anything like Angkor Wat in Cambodia you will be disappointed.  It's big, but not even close to that big.  The best time to see Bodobudur is during the annual Buddhist pilgrimage for Vesak during the full moon in May or June, commemmorating the birth, death, and time when Siddhartha Gautama became a Buddha.  The buddhists will walk from Mendut to Pawon and then to Bodobudur, quite a sight to see.  Barring that, there are a few special events throughout the year that the Visitors Center can tell you about, but otherwise it is still great to visit on any day.Bodobudur is about 40 km (25 miles) from Yogyakarta, and takes about 1 hour by car.  By far the best way to see Bodobudur is to stay at one of the local hotels so you can get there well before the tour buses from Yogyakarta arrive.  Entrance fee is $20.00 USD at the gate for all times except Sunrise.  The gates open at 6:00 AM, but by the time you get to the temple it will be nearly 7:00 AM.  If you get there at this hour, you will only have about 50 tourists with you on the temple.  The tour buses from Yogyakarta will mostly arrive about 10:00 AM and by then it is HOT and crowded.  Get in before the crowds while it's only a little bit hot, and out before they arrive.  Alternatively, you can visit late in the day when the buses have all gone.For an even better experience, Manohara hotel (located right next to the temple with a private entrance) will sell you a VIP Sunrise ticket for $40.00 USD, and you can get in by 4:30 AM.  At this time there are no people, well maybe a dozen, on the whole temple.  You have the whole place almost to yourself for about 2.5 hours, which is more than enough, even with a guided tour.  The sunrise is spectacular, illuminating the mist hanging in the jungle below, and the hulking Mt. Merapi.  The morning prayer from the nearby mosque sets the mood, while the mist is hanging heavy in the valleys, with the silence only broken by prayer, roosters and the chirping of the birds.  The feeling is mystical, and absolutely enchanting.  As the sun comes up, Mt. Merapi is illuminated, as slowly revealed as the morning clouds part.  Seven volcanoes are visible from Bodobudur on a clear day, plus two sleeping buddhas (use your imagination) and a 360 degree view of the jungle draped hillsides and valleys below.  Take a few photos of course, but make sure to leave yourself plenty of time to sit and soak up the amazing feeling of being here at this time.  The other hotels in Borobudur will arrange this VIP ticket for you as well, you don't have to stay at Manohora to have this experience, but you will want to stay in Borobudur and not in Yogyakarta.  Afterward, they give you coffee or tea and a couple bites of pastry.Manohora also sells tickets to the Sunset at the same price that include a guided tour.If you're wondering whether the sunrise is really worth the extra money and getting up soooo early, the answer is yes for sure.  If you're staying in Borobudur, the Imam at the local mosque will wake you up at 4:00 AM every morning anyway, so you might as well get up and head for the ruins.  We were happy we did, and then we came back when it started to get warm, had some breakfast and went back to sleep until the next round of prayers at the mosque began.  You can adequately visit the temple in 2 hours, even with a guided tour.For the best experience, you will want to hire a guide at the visitors center or the entrance - you can email them to arrange it in advance or do it on the spot.  The cost is 75,000 Rp, or about $7.00 USD.  The hotels will arrange this for you for a big surcharge - ours charged us 250,000 Rp, we found out later, which was a total rip.  Live and learn.  The guide can not only tell you the history of the place, but interpret the carvings for you and open your eyes to the teachings of buddhism.  Well worth $7.00 for about an hour tour, $25.00 is iffy, as their accent is often heavy, making it hard to understand.  If not doing a guide, then at least bring a guidebook so you can appreciate the history, significance, cosmology and architecture, if not so intricately.Bodobudur is the must-see attraction of Central Java.  Not worth taking a trip to Indonesia just to see it unless you are Buddhist, but if you're already in Java then you should definitely visit it.Do stay a couple nights or more in the area if you have the time - it's just beautiful.  I'm so happy we decided to stay here for 4 nights instead of in Yogyakarta, though worth a couple nights in the city as well to see the other temple there and the palace - it is an hour drive or a bit more.",2012-10-23,Couples,2012-10,,,

Both Borobudur and Angkor Wat are undoubtedly, the legacy of old civilization that we should not miss in South East Asia.The temple is one hour drive from our hotel in Yogya. As we travel in four, we rented a car with driver from a tour company with RP350k for 5 hours. We entered the park with RP125k (instead of RP135k). That was the special price given to the tourism company. We hired a local park tourguide, with RP75k for 2 hours. We found that a good English speak driver was really beneficial, as we gained many valuable information about visiting places, shopping, culture, and food from our driver. Our park touguide was very informative, and his English was excellent. We Learnt many from both of them.Yes, now about the big temple. Borobudur is built with dark bricks. It will be like baking oven in under blazing sun. So, be early if we don't want to get ourselves cooked. The sales person inside the park are promoting in ""aggresive"" manner. We need to be stern and strong in expressing that ""we are not going to buy"". What I had done, smile and said ""no!"", then, walk straight to my destination without looking at them anymore. I realized that the items sold by them can be available at Malioboro, with cheaper price.Food and beverage is only available outside of the temple area. Bringing enough drinking water is essential to keep us hydrated (we can get the bottled water at the park office, free of charge). Entering the park from the east, taking the photo of the temple early in the morning will be the best.

It is truly amazing and embodies a strong sense of peace and spiritualness (if there is such a word). There is a real serenity and tranquility about Borobudur.

Only ourselves and another couple bothered to do this however. Most people bolted up the stairs all the way to the top. ""Nirvana"" is to be achieved with patience and there is much to see and admire on each level as they are all so varied.

Last time we visited we were unable to climb to the top as it was being cleaned following eruptions from Mt Merapi, so this time we were delighted to have the opportunity to explore more than we had seen previously.  As we went without a guide this time we had more opportunity to linger and enjoy the marvellous carvings at our own leisure.  What wonderful stories are to be found in these carvings, some of which show scenes of everyday life at the time. Of course it is a great tragedy that so many of the buddha heads have been looted; removed no doubt to be sold as antiquities many years ago, but thankfully what remains for us to enjoy today is still intact in the main and will stand for a very long time into the future for generations of people.",2012-05-23,Couples,2012-05,australia,-24.7761086,134.755

,4.0,"We booked our trip through Rumah Guides in Yogyakarta (Attik, not Josh).  Important to know that if you book a guide for just this sight, or a combination of sights, that you must use a guide at the temple.  Which means that even if you get an outside guide service (for travel or other sights), you still must pay for a guide at the temple.  It wasn't much extra.  Our english-speaking guide was ok - he had good knowledge, but was hard to understand at times.  He did a good job explaining the history and information about the temple.  However, if you are a white person, be prepared to get your picture taken.  It was difficult to complete our tour because of the groups that asked us to be in photos.  The guidebooks all say this, but I was a bit unprepared for the sheer volume of photo requests.  Our guide was used to it I think - he seemed to expect people to ask him to take their picture with us.  The temple itself is extraordinary.  I do recommend a guide, because they give you a lot of information about what the temple means and how to approach it.  Perhaps if you had a good guide book, you wouldn't need a guide (Lonely Planet didn't have much info about the history).  Definitely worth seeing!",2012-05-14,Friends,2012-05,,,

(On a side note--the bathrooms in this area were super clean with get this--toilet paper and soap! Things you don't usually see in public toilets in Indonesia.) When we first reached the temple, there were only a few dozen people there, but it slowly began to pick up with groups of literally 100s of middle or high school aged kids. We would have only spent about 40 minutes total at the temple looking around and taking photos, but we were stopped and asked to have our pictures taken with these kids or other families about 50 times--it did feel kinda like being a celebrity and the kids were funny--but, then it started to get hot and crowds upon crowds of people started to arrive. We met back up with our group at a food stall for breakfast and we were amazed about the number of coach buses still pouring into the parking lot--unbelievable!

"Singapore, Singapore",5.0,"It is said that a divine architect named Gunadharma designed Borobudur. But from studies done, it is known that Borobudur was remodeled at least four times in 50 years, and therefore, cannot be the work of a single designer. The work to build this monument is thought to be around AD 760 or 770. The result was a series of seven square concentric terraces in decreasing size, rising like steps to three more concentric circular terraces, topped centrally by a huge bell shaped dome. The structure has no roof or vault, no chambers, like most temples, inferring therefore, that this place is not a place of worship. The masonry was laid without mortar. Standing on a small hill 15 meters above the Kedu Plain, it is bounded by rice fields and coconut groves and beyond this, by mountains on all sides. The structure is rich in complex decorations and beautiful bas-reliefs of 146 carved stone panels that would cover an area of 1900 square meters! Another 600 square meters of decorative carvings surround them and there are 54 life-sized Buddha statues carved from solid volcanic rock.  The overall design and the stories portrayed by the bas-reliefs is said to reflect the purpose of Borobudur’s existence which is, that the ancient Javanese pilgrims could come to climb this man-made holy mountain and attain spiritual merit, passing through 10 stages of development, that would transform them into enlightened bodhisattvas. Apparently, Borobudur is the only surviving monument of this type.We were there in the early hours of dawn to witness the sunrise over the horizon. This means getting to the top of the monument in darkness by 5.30am.  Surprisingly there were already a good number of people there at the top, several with cameras on tripods, pointing eastwards! The others were sitting around patiently waiting. It is not possible to describe in words the almost mystical like experience felt during the following minutes as the sun broke through the horizon with mist covering the foreground. Given the nature of the surrounding atmosphere, one unconsciously remained in silent reverence or spoke in whispers. We were informed that to witness the sunrise at the Borobudur, only a limited number of visitors are allowed in before 6am each morning. It's not a very strenuous climb to the top and there are public toilets in the grounds. Guides who speak different languages are available for an intellectual tour of the monument.Tickets and information are available at the Manohara Centre of Borobudur Studies, which is situated some 200 meters from the temple itself. The Centre can accommodate those who wish to spend the night in order to have access to the temple at an early hour to see the sunrise.Tips: Try to visit the monument for the sunrise. It's generally cooler unlike the rest of the day, and there are fewer visitors to clutter your photograph taking. Even at this time of the day, there's sufficient light to take pictures.Concentrate first on the sunrise in order not to miss this, and then do the tour of the bas-reliefs if you want a full experience of the monument.",2012-04-15,Couples,2012-04,singapore,1.357107,103.8194992

"Melbourne, Australia",5.0,"This is one of those places that you must see.  Remarkably, Lonely Planet lists Borobudur and Prambanan as day 3 and 4 items - clearly I am in the wrong demographic.  I visited it twice in a week - once to see it, and once for the sunrise.  You could do both in one visit, but it was good to have seen it so as to know what was emerging as the sun rose.Condition - Given the proximity to the Merapi Volcano, it is in great shape.  It has been restored over time.  It is possible to walk on all the terraces and view the carvings.  Some are in poor condition and some are in great condition.Musuem - There is a museum which outlines its history including the restoration.  (The museum also has a boat made in the shape of the boat in the carvings and sailed from Indonesia around the Cape of Good Hope along the spice route)).  Crowds - There can be a lot of people and it can be hot.  That being said, it is still very beautiful.  Usage - It is not currently used as a temple although I saw Buddhist monks chant and walk clockwise around the 3 terraces).Guides - A guide is useful to assist with the carvings and the general structure.  The guides I had contradicted themselves a little, so I have more reading to do about this temple.Sunrise - It is possible to be on Borobudur for the sunrise (through Mahohara Hotel - cost is 335,000 rupiah and you should get there at about 5am).  This ended up being quite a noisy experience because of tourists and their guides.  Photos could be taken as tourists moved out of frame.  Despite all this it was still a great experience, with the sun rising between the Merapi Volcano and another volcano, and the mists in the hills (cadera?) around Borobudur gradually dissipating.  Timing - It takes about 1 hour by car to get there (less in the very early morning).Surrounds - It is surrounded by well groomed gardens.",2012-04-14,Couples,2012-04,australia,-24.7761086,134.755

Jakarta,4.0,"I have visited Yogyakarta once in late December. I went there with my friends by car from Jakarta. It took about 12 hours to go there, very far away if we go to Yogyakarta. But we satisfied during on the road, because along the trip we could see so many beautiful things from the car. We could see views, houses,restaurants,mountains,etc. 12 hours means nothing for us, it felt like only 3 hours trip because of those things. We departed from Jakarta at 8:00 PM, we planned to be arrived in Yogyakarta in the morning, so before late night we had to go. Each 3 hours, we stopped to take a rest in the car and eat. The traffic was not bad, so  we can drive the car smoothly. The sun had come, it meant Yogyakarta almost be reached. And we was happy. At 9:00 am, Finally we arrived in Yogyakarta. Directy we went toward Borobudur Temple for our first destination. Because Borobudur Temple is so vast, before started the adventure in Borobudur, we took a rest for a while and bought some foods there. For your info, the entrance ticket of Borobudur Temple is Rp 12.500. But I heard that since 15 January 2012, the price has changed to Rp 15.000 and Rp 17.000 for weekend. But don’t worry about that price, you will never disappointed when you visit Borobudur Temple, it still the most recommended attraction in Yogyakarta. For lunch, we chose to visit Jejamuran Restaurant, in Sleman. Menus majority of this restaurants are full of mushrooms (Jamur in Indonesian). We decided to buy sate jamur and sop jamur. The taste? Do not doubt it, very delicious. We only spent Rp 10.000 for each menus, it was absolutely cheap for the delicious food like this.   After having a lunch, we went toward anther temple, that is Prambanan Temple. One of the legendary temple in Yogyakarta, and one of the best attraction in Yogyakarta. The area is smaller than Borobudur Temple has, but the view of Prambanan Temple area is better. The entrance ticket of Prambanan Temple is same as Borobudur Temple, not expensive enough for the good attraction. We spent 2 hours at Prambanan Temple then we moved to Ratu Boko Temple. From Prambanan Temple to Ratu Boko Temple, we took 2 hours trip, far enough indeed. When we arrived there, the sun almost gone. Ratu Boko Temple is not as popular as Borobudur and Prambanan Temple. But at here, we can enjoy the fresh air and we can see the beauty of Merapi mountain while eating snack and drinking coffee. The second day in Yogyakarta, we decided to visit Kasongan Desa Wisata, the center of pottery craft. It is located in Bantul. From the city we took 30 minutes to be Kasongan Village. Many good pottery crafts can be seen here. After bought some pottery crafts in Kasongan, we moved toward Rumah Budaya Tembi (Tembi Cultural House), it is a cultural museum of Java. The whole collections is special from Java such as kitchen stuffs (Tungku, Dandang), Java weapons, Farming stuff,etc. Do now worry if you want to visit Rumah Budaya  Tembi, it’s all free, no fee. We love this place, because all of us is Java tradition lovers. Then, our last destination is Pasar Seni Gabusan (Gabusan Art Market). From the name you must know  this place. Yes, this is a market of art. We bought some souvenirs to be brought to Jakarta. Various  prices can be found here. From Rp 5000 – hundred thousands can be found. Finally, this was our third day in Yogyakarta, the last day we were in Yogyakarta. No many places we  would visit in this day, because in the afternoon we had to go home to Jakarta. In the morning, we went  to Pasar Beringharjo (Beringharjo Traditional Market) to buy some snacks to be eaten in the car during  in trip to Jakarta. Then we moved to Malioboro to bring t-shirts, shorts, and Yogyakarta merchandises.

I can recommend the book by John Miksic titled ""Borobudur, Golden Tales of the Buddhas"" and although I may not get to return to Indonesia I would have liked to have read this before visiting. The story of how the complex was found and then renovated is absolutely fascintaing. This a must for anyone visiting Java, and well worth the efoort to get there, although it should be said that the existing infrastrucure for travel makes that a bit of a challenge!

I have been to ancient Buddhist temples in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam and this was far different from anything I have seen. The style of architecture is very different from the other temples and truly unique. I had wanted to go here for years and I was not disappointed. I would recommend visiting here in the early morning or evening, because it can get quite hot during the day. Also, watch out for local school kids who are brought here on a ""field trip."" They come simply to talk to foreigners and can be quite unpleasant if you are trying to enjoy the temple.

I didn't know much about this place until I got to Java and i am sooo glad we made the effort to go. This place is a about 1 to 1 half hours away from the centre of Yogyakarta. But it was well worth the trip. It take a bit of time to climb up enjoy the view and absorb the environment. It is a bit of a climb up stairs especially if it is hot and muggy, take it easy and it's not that bad at all. note they give you a free bottle of cold water with your ticket, take that and it will keep you cool.If you are staying in Yogyakarta my advice is to negotiate a rate with a cab driver to take you to the temple wait for you and bring you back, as when we were there were no taxi's waiting around.

"Sydney, Australia",5.0,"We visited from a cruise ship MS Zaandam which docked at Semarang on Friday January 6. We (2a & 2 boys - aged 11 & 13) had prearranged a driver and guide with a large 6 seater car which was very comfortable from Borobudur Tour & Travel. They were reasonably priced and reliable and less than half the cost that the cruise line (Holland America Line) were charging for a coach tour to Borobudur.We left Semarang around 7.15 and arrived at Borobudur around 9.45. The traffic was bad but not quite as bad as we had been led to expect or feared. Borobudur is a huge 8th century Buddhist Temple with some excellent stone carvings, It has been wonderfully restored and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.There were very few overseas tourists visiting but there were huge crowds of Indonesians, especially large school groups. Overseas tourists avoid the long entrance quesues of the locals for which we paid about 4 times as much - USD15 and USD8 (kids and students) and use a separate entry gate. I don't favour this differential pricing and hope that in time we are all treated equally. The temple tour guide was a bit hard to understand at first but we soon got used to him. He also had a trainee guide who smiled a lot but didn't say much.Be warned that access around the site is difficult if you have some mobility challenges - there are lots of steps to climb and these steps are steep although some staircases had hand rails. It can also get very hot although it wasn't so hot on our visit.Much of the drive though Java is quite picturesque and we stopped for some fresh durian half-way back. It was delicious.

Who all had to do a project involving interviewing an English speaking tourist about their home and experiences traveling in Indonesia. We were two of maybe a half dozen westerners there. These poor kids had slim pickings and literally swarmed my partner and I to ask us their canned questions. Sounds like a recipe for disaster but it turned out just the opposite. It was an amazing experience and hilarious to pose for pictures with literally hundreds of javanese and sumatrian kids. We had a blast but couldn't really focus on the temple. Which turned out to be OK since we did both the private sunrise and sunsets (about $20 each) which basically gave you the temple to yourself (ok, you shared it with maybe a dozen other tourists) for two hours or so in the evening and the morning when the light was way better for picture taking anyway. My advice: Go during the break between christmas and new year's. The temple is swarmed with indonesian school kids who will crack you up during the day but you'll have the termple virtually to yourself during the sunrise and sunsets due to the low numbers of non-domestic tourists. It's a win-win. And stay at the Manohara for easy access to the temple.",2012-01-01,Couples,2011-12,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882
"Millbrae, CA",5.0,"Pictures can't truly describe how magnificent and impressive that Borobudur Temple is.  You've got to see it in person, walk around the different sides of the structure, and leisurely stroll through the different levels of Borobudur Temple to soak it all in.  I came in with pretty low expectations because it was my girlfriend who was the one really pushing to make a special flight during our two week Indonesia trip from Jakarta to Yogyakarta with an extra hour drive to Borobudur.  We had to time our trip so tightly that we stayed less than 18 hours in Borobudur (including sleep time).  Part of the reason why I was not very enthusiastic to go was because that I had read the top levels of Borobudur Temple were still closed due to a nearby volcano eruption in October & November of 2010.   After figuring that I would never be back to Indonesia anytime in the next 10 years and at the high recommendation of a few Tripadvisor reviewers I reached out to before making the trip, I was really glad that the stars aligned to allow me to go.   I also read in a few places that Borobudur Temple was ranked the 10th ""wonder of all of Asia"" and 35th ""wonder of the world""!!!  With those kind of ratings, it really would have been a shame not to go.Admission was about $8 USD/person and we hired a official Borobudur Temple English guide for 75,000 Rupiah.  People have different opinions about whether to hire a guide or not but for the reasonable price, we felt that learning more about the history of such a magnificent monument made the experience even more special.  We used our tour guide not just as a tool of knowledge but also as our personal photographer and he did a splendid job for whatever photos we wanted around the monument.    With so many English tour guides available and a stagnant amount of visitors, our guide expressed that he only gets the opportunity to give two tours a day so we made sure to tip generously as I would recommend to everyone going.  Even though we weren't able to set foot on the upper levels where the stupas were located, we got close enough to be able to take pictures and get fairly close to the stupas.  Getting there early ensures that you'll have smaller crowds and less tourists with their big umbrellas in your photos.  We stayed at Lotus Guesthouse 1 which was literally around the corner from Borobudur Temple and although not the best condition guesthouse, it was as cheap as rusty nails and amazingly convenient few minute walk away.Try to allocate at least 2-3 hours at a minimum and really enjoy this 8th/9th century Indonesian Buddhist wonder.",2012-01-01,,2011-09,united states,39.7837304,-100.445882

See my photos and more details here: http://inidisini.wordpress.com/2011/12/10/visit-to-borobudur-the-greatest-place-you-never-heard-of/ I didn't hire a guide because I read a lot about Borobudur online and in my LP guidebook. I think it depends on your interest. If you just want to have a look, you can take a day trip from Yogyakarta and that might be okay for you. But for me, this was one of the top places I wanted to visit in all the world. If that's also you, then definitely go up to the top before sunrise!

Singapore,4.0,"The reason we wanted to visit central Java was because of the much talkabout Borobudur temple.We travelled so far just to see this remarkable Ancient piece of History. We had to go through many winding roads, dangerous mountaineous cliffs, dangerous roads filled with massive cargo trucks to finally arrived at this temple. We would say it was worth the visit except for some minor displeasure, mostly with the service encountered. Yes, people would say this is because it is in Indonesia. We still wonder why? Many Indonesians are hired for their hospitality in service industry and homes but why is  poor service prominent at tourism sites? It does leave a very poor, first impression. We would advise visitors to just take a flight to Surubaya and then a car to this monument. There are buses but mostly for domestic tourists. However this country still charges different rates for domestic and foreign tourists. Why this is so, we cannot understand. Perhaps United Nations or the Human Rights professional can establish why the charges can be more for foreigners and how do they determine that every tourist traveling to see this monument is a wealthy person that can afford to be charged 4 times the local rates. Do any countries charge Indonesians  Rich and Famous a higher fee because they are rich?Do any countries charge all Indonesians any fee higher than the local?We recall China did when we visited 15 years ago.Not sure if it is still the same.;)However, because of the people who tirelessly build Borobudur temple, we will definitely visit  ONCE.The temple is just magnificent, just by the sheer size and the architecture phenomena of the design. It consists of various layers and each structure has a buddha inside, if you can see it. Of course, as we walk about the temple, we also witness some of the damaged ones. It seems the earthquake had destroyed them and in the past, with money funded by various organisations for the restoration projects, slowly and surely it has been restored.However, there is still much more that can be done. For one, perhaps some translation for the English speaking to make it more interesting. Example, some description of each of the many statues, etc. We will suggest tourists read the history before embarking on a trip to the temple unless you want to hire a professional guide.There are two entrances, one for the locals and one for the RICH and WEALTHY FOREIGNERS, regardless of your profession. They must have figured out that ALL foreigners are RICH and WEATLHY and ALL Indonesians are POOR.;oWe would not mind if they had charged us the same rate and then let us offer a donation for the temple. It would be more professional, reasonable and HUMANE.( consumer rights group to take note)If you are with your local friends, they want you to enter by separate gates. Of course, we all refused politely.It is impolite to allow our gracious hosts to pay a HIGHER TICKET PRICE for us and ask them to enter by a cheaper price gate...sigh...Yes, the Indonesian hosts were delightful and paid knowing we are foreigners.Do they earn alot of money?NO!NO!NO!Do they want us to pay them back? NO! NO! NO! Now, how do you handle such a situation. We wonder how much harder they have to work to make the money back.;(We hosted them when they were in our country and they graciously wanted to show us BOROBUDUR. At the entrance, you have to don a sarong. Kind of strange cos Buddhist temple does not require us to wear a sarong? Perhaps this is ritual only in Indonesia as a token of respect for the GODs. However, there were also many locals without sarongs???What inconsistency?Now, inorder to appease the GODS, we decide to obey. ;)They also take away any food items in your bag. You can put them in a locker. They were afraid you litter on site yet we see many water bottles thrown inside the temple. We went and we saw what we wanted to see. It was a great experience productwise but with the services rendered, we were disappointed. They were interested to collect money from tourists, sell products to tourists but here we want to learn about the temple and the people whom build this magnificent monument for the world to see. Somehow, we still prefer ANGKOR WAT.Borobudur temple is about 30 minutes by car  from Magelang town. Do bring some food and water as you may not find decent or preferred food along the journey.We were glad that we have seen it. Will we go back again. No. unlike the Great Wall of China and the Forbidden City, Angkor Wat, where we had visited many times or will visit,we think unless tourism here takes care of overseas visitors, we may just read it up on the internet or history books.Yes, it has been given the WORLD HERITAGE TITLE and will surely attract many visitors but we feel the service and treatment of foreigners need to improve.

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",4.0,"First tip - Skip the tour guide and read up as much as you can about BorobudurHowever, if you still want to opt for a tour guide, I'll recommend that too. Borobudur is a Buddhist temple, constructed without any cement (I am sure of the base, not of the top though) and survived multiple natural disasters for centuries, still standing strong. It is truly fascinating to just gaze at the blocks of huge/heavy bricks, individually shaped to look like a puzzle, while you are standing on it, imagining the genius behind this whole temple!This place is definitely worth the visit, though I wish tourists would be more considerate about carrying their colorful umbrellas around. Firstly, it spoils every single photo I took of Borobudur, even from afar (colorful specks, bah!). Secondly, some people don't bother avoiding you despite noticing that their umbrella is only a few inches from jabbing you in the eye!Before the last earthquake, tourists were allowed to reach up to one of the stupas with a Buddha seated inside and touch the Buddha. It is a believe that if a male managed to touch the Buddha's foot, and a female managed to touch the Buddha's hand (or is it the other way around?!?), that person will be blessed and receive good fortune.I can sense more history and culture at Borobudur than Prambanan (availability of information). Go for the Audio/Visual screening on a brief history of the temple. You can skip that too if you want as they have multilingual pamphlets on the discovery and recovery of Borobudur. Beware of multiple Borobudur merchandise sellers running after you as you exit, persuading you to ""buy a souvenir, very cheap.."". It's a challenge trying to get away from them (the climb up to the top of Borobudur is peanuts compared to this). If you are serious about purchasing something, bargain for 1/3 of the price offered (or whatever amount you think it's worth - don't be a cheapskate too!). If you are not planning to buy anything, walk on, don't ask about the price - you will have a 20-minute stalker then unless you purchase an item!Entrance fee: USD15 (I am not sure if this includes the tour guide or not.

My guide, Mas Mura, is proficient in English and we do really enjoy his company throughout the tour. Guides just cost IDR 75000, (USD$8) . Try not to buy from the peddlers, and if you must, ask for less than half of what is quoted and haggle from there. Books on Borobudur are easily available in bookshops elsewhere for cheaper price. There are souvenirs shops just off the temple grounds. And try to avoid visiting during the afternoon (HOT!) and weekends where throngs of locals and kids visit the place.

"Melaka, Malaysia",5.0,"Borobudur is perhaps the most popular icon of Indonesia. And after setting eyes on this magnificent structure, one just cannot deny that the Borobudur is indeed one of the must visit sites in the world.Believed to have been built between the 8th and 9th centuries, it was built way ahead of Cambodia's Angkor Wat and 400 years before work began on the great European cathedrals.Borobudur, which is considered as the greatest Buddhist monuments in the world, was founded by a king of the Saliendra dynasty.Borobudur was built in three tiers, namely a pyramidal base with five concentric square terraces; the trunk of a cone with three circular platforms and a monumental stupa at the top.The main attraction here is without doubt the wall of the galleries which are are adorned with reliefs depicting the life of Buddha and the principles of his teaching. To read this entire Buddhist 'text book' to attain enlightenment, one has to walk for more than two miles. While most of these reliefs are still visible, certain portions are less visible, probably due to the age of the temple.As a visit to Borobudur will entail a lot of walking, you are advised to be lightly dressed, including having comfortable shoes. While it can be tiring walking from one corner of Borobudur to another, it is nevertheless a worthwhile experience.Take your time to enjoy the scenery and also the magnificent works put into building this temple complex which has stood the test of time, including frequent earthquakes.The Borobudur Temple Complex is listed as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) world heritage site.",2011-10-14,,2011-01,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",5.0,"This is the main reason for visiting Yogyakarta. This historical site is a fascination. If you are really interested in the history behind this fascinating monument, you can easily hire a tour guide. We did this on our own. As we stayed in Manohara which is within the compound of the temple (hence no entrance fee required), we visited the temple few times during our 2-night-stay. This included the early morning sunrise tour, which we found not so spectacular. The sunrise view was not worth the amount we paid. We never got bored as there were new things that we discovered every time.The relief and buddha sculptures are amazing. There are so many photo opportunities. The view from the upper levels is very beautiful. At the entrance/exit, there are many locals trying to sell souvenirs; from t-shirt to miniature temple/buddha sculptures; and many more. If you are interested in them, bargain as the price offered initially can be very high. At the end, they may be cheaper than those from Malioboro town.There are many stairs to climb but they are fairly manageable. Just make sure you bring along lots of water, a hat and sunglasses as the heat can be really strong.When we visited in March 2011, the upper levels were closed for renovation work.

"Philadelphia, PA",4.0,"After reading reviews of both Boroburdur and Prambanan, some of the comments left me in doubt as to whether we should go out to Borobudur. But, we did go and Im glad we did.  The header for this attraction says it is ""Free"", which it is not.  It is $15usd but only $7 if you have your student ID! (Which we didn't! Blah! Bring yours!) We chose to take ourselves there by motorbike instead of doing a group tour, and I really think doing it yourself is the way to go.  True, we did not see sunrise nor sunset, but we also weren't jammed in there with 300 other people all at once.  They say its THE most visited site in all of Indonesia.  We arrived about 1:30 and left before 4 (when all the sunset tourists started rolling in).  It was quite peaceful but the views are lovely.  And it was so weird, that on the way in we completely missed Mt. Merapi looming over us, but on the way out we were like ""Whoa! Volcano!""  Its about 2 hours by motorbike, very straightforward drive.  But only take a motorbike if you're feeling very proficient about driving one- traffic gets so heavy.  They're going to ask you to wear a sarong, so if you have your own you can bring that too.

"London, UK",5.0,"We visited Borobudur in early September 2011.  Our hotel in Jogya, Rumah Mertua, arranged for a driver to take us to the Manohara Hotel for around 4am for a sunrise tour.  Our official guide, Fatah, was arranged for us by Rumah Mertua and he was fantastic.  The hotel gave us torches, sarongs and tea and a snack after the tour.The extra cost of the sunrise tour and a guide were absolutely worth it - the first means that you explore the temple with only a handful of other people for the first hour or two and the second allows you to get the most out of your visit, both to understand the history and context of the temple but also to understand some of the many beautiful carvings.  In addition, you enjoy your snack at the hotel with a beautiful view of the temple in peace afterwards, away from all the stalls selling souvenirs (and you exit through the hotel not via the stalls).The top two levels of the temple were closed when we visited (further to the volcanic eruption a few months ago) but that really didn't matter - we could still go to the level directly underneath the large stupas and were able to view all the carvings.The gardens that the temple is set within are beautiful and the small museums on site are also worth a visit.You could spend hours at the temple itself walking around each level, past each and every carving, but after our first visit we were back at the Manohara hotel to have our snack by around 8am.Our second trip (two days later) we entered through the standard 'foreign tourist' entry at around 7.30am and spent 2 or so hours wandering around the temple, viewing all the carvings.  You can do so in flip flops or sandles - no need to wear trainers or walking boots.  This time we had to exit through the maze of tourist stalls but generally, the sellers don't pester you and a smile and a shake of the head goes a long way.Don't be offended if you find people taking photos of you or asking if they can take photos of you.

"Guangzhou, China",3.0,"We thought we would spend a night at Borobudur and try to avoid the crowds at the temple.We got a 20,000 rupiah taxi (from Malioboro) to the bus station - Jombor - 5 km north of the city centre. Once there we were directed to the bus to take us direct to Borobudur. It was a local one, about 30 seats. The cost was 20,000 - a tour operator in Malioboro said it would cost about this much for foreigners. The journey only took an hour. Once at Borobudur bus station, touts descended, one or two can be quite persistent. The temple is only a 500m walk from the bus station. We walked to our hotel which was a bit further, and decided the photos showed it in its prime so didnt stay.The Borobudur complex has bag storage, a few restaurants and a couple hundred souvenir stalls. As it was Ramadan and midday when we arrived it was quite calm but I can imagine it being quite full on at other times.Ticket prices are 15US$ - you can pay in Rupiah too - and include a bottle of water and the loan of a sorong that all people must wear. The temple is quite impressive but as a singular building shouldn't really be compared to Angkor Wat. Some of the carvings are well preserved,but almost all of the buddhas have been beheaded. The top section is being renovated and in places silver plastic covers the stone. We directed out, you need to negotiate the stalls, which seem to go on endlessly.

Orlando,5.0,"Travelers: 1 woman (45) & 1 girl (age 8) from USAOur journey thu Indonesia continues... We had the great luck to visit Borobudur  Temple. Hidden in a remote jungle location, it was not easy to get there from the coast. We arrived to Java by cruise ship, and made our arrangements for the visit to the temple thru the ship excursion department. Some people think they will save $ doing their own arrangements with guides, but you have to know when thats a good idea and when its not. The ship provided us with a police escort to/from the temple because the roads were so difficult. The road is not in bad shape, its just that it is a 2 lane highway most of the way, and appeared to be the ONLY road in the whole city! So the traffic was crazy, the drivers were crazy, like something you see in a movie. I can only say that the drive ITSELF was like an excursion they could charge $ for. The weaving in & out of ONCOMING traffic... on our bus we heard a collective gasp every few minutes ! We also rode part of the way on an authentic antique train, 100 years old, and were able to see villages, rice fields, etc. The windows of the train don't close, and smoke from the engine occasionally pours in, be prepared. Locals were coming out just to wave hello to us as we passed by, very friendly (I guess WE were the attraction that day). The train couldn't make it all the way to the top station where the bus was waiting for us. I think they overloaded the train (25 American tourists weigh alot more than 25 Indonesians), so we all had to get off the train & wait by the side of the road for the bus. I mention this because you should know when you are in Indonesia, or any remote location, expect the unexpected. I still highly recommend the train, because it was a way to see the countryside in a beautiful way. But onto the temple... it was raining lightly that day (it rains alot in Indonesia, be prepared with those disposable ponchos). We arrived at the temple with a knowlegable guide (the key to enjoying this temple). The guide described the various statues, reliefs, etc. as we climbed the stairs to the top of this enormous monument. They have installed hand rails for safety. The steps are huge though, so I was a little intimidated,but it was fine. Since you are going up to each level & pausing to look around, the climb up is not difficult. At the top you will see giant Stupas, & a glorious view of the surrounding jungle. You reach inside the Stupa to touch Buddahs foot for luck. You have to be a contortionist to do this, my daughter did it, I only reached his leg. After the temple visit they served lunch at a nearby pavilion (with western style restrooms :)    A word about Indonesian bathrooms: just ""hold it"".   PLEASE DO visit this incredible monument.

These hawkers will follow tourists ceaselessly along the way to the monument.  But relax, they are trying to earn a living.  If you want a really quiet viewing experience, do it like I did, stay in Hotel Manohara inside Borobudur Park.  I arrived at noon by taxi from Yogyakarta and checked in to the hotel to enjoy a relaxing tea and admired the beautiful garden setting of the hotel.  The hot weather is unbearable.  Don't climb up to Borobudur now.  I retired to my A/C room for a siesta and ventured out again at 4PM.I slowly approached Borobudur, and out of magic, it was situated in the back garden of Hotel Manohara.  A couple of hawkers still hanged around with their trade but I shake them off.  I walked up this world's greatest monument built between 778 and 842 AD, then being abandoned after 1100 AD and subsequently buried in the jungle.  After being rediscovered in 1815, the following century saw international help pouring in for restoration.  With UNESCO helping to raise money, almost US$ 23 million, and the gigantic task of rescuing Borobudur was launched in August 1973.  Work was completed in 10 years and re-opened in 1983.  Borobudur is a three-dimensional Mandala with bas-reliefs depicting the delights and damnations of the physical world; the outer processional path and four square terraces show the life of Prince Siddharta on his way to becoming Buddha.  The three circular terraces on top support 72 latticed miniature stupas, some emptied but other contain the statue of Buddha.  At the top, a giant stupa symbolizes the sphere of formlessness and the ascension to the realm of Sublime Reality.  Although it was almost closing time (at 6PM), I remembered the crowd, the heat and the steps.  Thankfully, I was to join the Sunrise Tour the next morning for a more tranquil experience.I was with a dozen of other hotel guests being transferred by vans to the locked gate in front of the monument before 5AM.  Huge spotlights illuminated Borobudur.  Heavy among mist, Borobudur was eerie at this hour.  I sat quietly on top of the terrace to wait for the first ray of light coming from behind Mt. Merapi illuminating the dark silhouette of Borobudur and bring life to the green valley below.  I was lost in words.  Borobudur in the sea of mist was simply magical.

What concerned me was litter that was lying around (although on closing there were a number of cleaners emptying the litter bins and trying to pick up all the water bottles etc, that visitors had left lying about) but most of all the fact that despite notices people were allowed to climb and crawl about the temple without restriction.  Surely this will cause irreparable damage over time?For anyone visiting, like me, to watch the sunset from the top of the temple, be warned that they actually close most of the gates well before sunset and the last gate is closed ten minutes or so before the sun goes down (presumably for safety).

There’s also Prambanan, very old Hindu temple, Merapi volcano and the Sultan’s Palace. And off course shopping for batik, finest in Indonesia, handicrafts very cheap and great Indonesian food.We had a good flight, on time to and fro. Food was pre ordered when I book the tickets, so we got our food first. Only thing we should have bought is the pre boarding, otherwise have to rush with the rest. So if you have young children and elderly, do book the pre boarding it’s worth it. Also pre-purchased the check in bags charges. Everything was smooth sailing.Many hotels available to cater to various budgets, which I think is great. We decided to stay in small local managed hotel, more like a home actually, with only 11 rooms. We took 1 Family room and 1 Standard room. Pool was nice; landscaping was beautiful, very clean and good breakfast. Hotels is called Rumah Mertua, away from the busy bustling city noise. We liked that. To move around, taxis are aplenty, but we decided to rent an MPV since there were 6 of us. Rental fee was not too bad Rp450k for 10 hours with driver and petrol.There are 2 shopping malls, the best is Ambarok Mall, newest. The older one is Malioboro Mall, should visit both. Jalan Malioboro is the main shopping street, you can spend the whole day there, Must visit is Mirota Batik, I went crazy there, the batiks are so beautiful and reasonable priced.Majority of people there are very friendly, especially the sales staff at the shops, always smiling and eager to assist.With the above experiences, do include Yogja as one of your future destinations for a short break, 3 nights is sufficient.",2009-02-04,,,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823

Make sure bring along umbrella or just a nice hat.,2009-01-17,,,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823
"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",5.0,"Borobudur, as is all ancient monuments, where some are listed  and some are not listed in the Wonders of the World list, yet they are all as magnificence in the way they are built as those listed ones. They have always left for us subtle messages about our universe. The deep emotional feelings you will get when you close your eyes and open your hearts, you will definitely feel the presence of unconditional love.Borobudur emits the same effects of unconditional love as you climb through its 10-level of symbolic  enlightenment passages. As you would circumambulate the galleries and terraces at every level, you will feel without doubt the peace within.There are not a lot of guest houses within walking distance from the Borobudur complex. There is a Manohara Hotel which has rooms from Rp400,000 onwards (RM140), but you get to walk into Borobudur anytime during opening hours and a special permission for house guests to also include a sunrise walkabout. If you stay in the resort-like hotel, you get to go into Borobudur compound without having to pay extra for the entrance ticket.The entrance ticket (or you may call it the conservation fund) is USD11 per person for 1-day pass. I can use the ticket to go in at 6am when it opens and stay throughout the day until 5pm or I can re-enter anytime. I checked into a Lotus I guest house with room costs only Rp60,000 (RM15) with a fan, a Queen-size bed with an attached bath. If there are 2 of us, we can share the cost. Very affordable, shoe-string budget traveling at its best!No written record that can confirm how old is Borobudur but many claim that it dates back to the 8th century, almost the same time as Angkor Wat.  It is a very fascinating structure with 1,460 bas-reliefs on its walls depicting cause and effects at the lowest level, Jataka tales (stories which Gautama told the people after he gained enlightenment as the Buddha) at the middle levels, and the highest few levels are in circular design, going round without beginning and end. Isn't that what life is? It never ends, just got to repeat all the stuff and issues until we learnt it, I guess that is what enlightenment means.I got myself a bicycle and I rode to visit other places in the vicinity while I also enjoyed the foods with such delicacies like barbecued duck, soto nasi (rice) with chicken and a cup of 3-in-1 chocolate - all for Rp9,500 (RM2.50). Well, great food at a fraction of what we can get in Kuala Lumpur.Read more at my blog :http://www.lifestyledesigners.blogspot.com",2008-12-01,,,malaysia,4.5693754,102.2656823
"Washington, DC",5.0,"You have probably already gathered from the other posts that the temple is awesome and lives up to its high expectations, so I won't dwell on that. My advice is to stay in the lovely and inexpensive hotel in the park. That makes it easy to get up at sunset and beat some of the crowds (not all). If you stay just below the very top for the sunrise you will be alone. Gradually make your way down the temple to stay ahead of the tourist whirlwind that gathers first at the top and you can feel like you have the place to yourself for 1-2 hours. Staying in the park is much more pleasant than staying in Yogya. If you insist on luxury accommodations and you have so much money it is falling out of your pockets as you walk you can stay at the nearby 5 star Amanjiwo.If you have time before you go you should also visit the hill nearby from which you get a nice view of the temple.

"The Hague, The Netherlands",5.0,"The Borobudur temple is a spectacular structure surrounded by steamy jungles.  Although it pales in comparison to Ankor Wat in Cambodia, this ancient building on the isle of Java is an impressive site.  The detailed carvings on the many relief panels and the abundant Buhhda statues coupled with it's shear size make this temple quite unique.  According to the locals, the lower tier is covered with erotic imagery that was considered offensive to the sensibilities of the local Muslim population and is covered with stone and plywood to make the temple more acceptable.  One can still catch a glimpse of the exotic forbidden 9th century carvings in places though.  This unexpected taboo adds to the mystique of this temple in my opinion.Try to catch the temple early in the morning for the best light and to beat the heat! (It gets REALLY hot and humid out there!) The rich photographic opportunities are not just limited to this ancient structure but also extend to the local people and their way of life.  Local school children who are visiting Borobudur will come up to Westerners often to practice their English skills and frequently they will ask to take pictures with you as well, especially if you're blonde and blue-eyed like my wife.  It's an interesting experience to be sightseeing in an exotic foreign culture and yet be the subject of the locals own sightseeing trips.When you get tired of the heat at the temple, have your guide take you to the Aman Hotel for lunch.  This exclusive resort has a great view of the temple and the surrounding jungle from the patio dining area of the restaurant.  The food and service are five-star and it's a nice way to wrap up a hot morning of sightseeing.",2008-03-11,,,netherlands,52.2434979,5.6343227
Bandung,5.0,"I went to Borobudur at the beginning of this month. Actually it isn't my first visit. As a child, I went to Borobudur several times on school trip. All I remember is how big it was and I was panting my breath to get to the top. Now for anyone who has a plan to go there, here’s my review.First, don’t bother to go there early morning just to catch the sunrise. You’d better arrange your time to arrive just before six o’clock; it’s when the gate opens. Local pays Rp 9000 while foreigner ticket is ten times higher (Rp 90.000 or USD 11). If you’re interested to the history, you may hire a tour guide on ticket gate; they’ll costs Rp 50.000. The ninth century architecture was magnificent. While entering the temple you’ll realize that it’s built on a bedrock hill. The main vertical structure is head / top, body, and foot / base. Each layer has narrow corridor with detail relief on the wall. Those reliefs are both decorative and narrative, so your guide will take you around in clockwise direction to tell the story. Avoid main stairs (east side) because it’s crowded and sunny (it’s morning time). I recommend west stairs to start climbing the stairs. We went up one level and encircle it clockwise through the corridor until we met our starting point; we continue that way until reached the top. No panting, we took our time to enjoy the relief. We realized that final three layers at the top was circular shape, decorated with Buddha statues and bell shaped stupa. You’ll just love the view from the top, because Borobudur is surrounded by mountain scenery. I took some picture of Buddha statue facing the mount.We complete viewing Borobudur less than two hours. It was faster than our prediction, so we went to the audio visual room near the entrance gate to watch thirty minutes Borobudur video. We asked for Japanese language video. English and Indonesian also available, but I’m not sure about other language. The video was informative, but the audio quality is low. Don’t imagine a movie theatre. We sat on individual wooden chair, watching the video just slightly bigger size compared to standard overhead projector screen at our office. The air con makes us sleepy, while the room’s strong flower fragrance keeps us awake.Concern items:The bookseller around the temple offers Borobudur related books; it’s cheap but I won’t recommend it. Moreover, if you really want to buy a historical book, you can go to a bookstore in Yogyakarta. We didn’t shop any souvenir there to avoid pickpocket. Watch your step because Borobudur has steep stairs. Local school pupil sometimes asked foreigners to take picture with them. Actually it’s OK if they’re on one group, but we met them by small groups on every corner. We can imagine how tired being a celebrity, hahaha…",2008-01-31,,,indonesia,-2.4833826,117.8902853
"Waimea, HI",5.0,"We drove car from Jogjakarta to Borobudur temple takes about almost one hour. It is a beautiful scenic road with rice fields, Chandi (small temple) with amazing sculptures all over it. It shows you the story of the temple you visit.Before Borobudur, there is also Prambanan temple, they have Rama & Shinta shows at certain night with Javanesse style dinner buffet.Borobudur is nineth century Buddhist temple. It was disvocer by Sir Thomas Raffles in 1814. They found the temple covered with plants and untouchable. It was huge as mountain.The stairs in Borobudur temple leads you to the top, along levels, there are lots of stone carvings, sculptures, and small Buddha statues. This carving tells you about the story of the biggest Javanesse kingdom in old days.Some people believe if you could touch Buddha's statue tumb and circle counter clock wise the statue for 7 times, your wish will be granted or you will have a good luck.

If you don't grab it, you can go to the ticket office after the door opens at 6:30 to queue up and get a number, and buy the climbing ticket in order.

Japan,4.0,"It's one of the places I've wanted to go for a long time, so I visited with great expectations.Borobudur is not a Buddhist ruin surrounded by amazing ruins like Angkor Wat, but rather has the image of a temple that suddenly appears in an ordinary mountain village.The ruins themselves are wonderful, but unfortunately we were not able to climb to the top, probably as a measure against overtourism.Although the ruins are large, there isn't anything particularly interesting to see around it, so I think 2 hours will be enough.I took the DAMRI bus directly from YIA with my luggage to visit, but the mountain road was quite undulating, so if you tend to get motion sickness easily, I recommend going via Yogyakarta city.",2023-08-15,Solo,2023-08,japan,36.5748441,139.2394179
"Rome, Italy",5.0,"What can I say about the temple….it must be seen!And possibly climbing to the top.There are two types of tickets, the cumulative one with Prambanan only allows you to visit the outside, walking in the garden that surrounds it.The other costs a little more but is worth the price, the guide and the obligatory complimentary slippers are also included so as not to damage the monument.The first type can be purchased on the same day at the ticket office while the second must be booked and tickets sell out quickly.The much touted sunrise at the temple is not inside but from a nearby hill, the temple opens at 8am. While the sunset can be seen from inside as it closes at 5pm.",2023-08-12,Solo,2023-08,italy,42.6384261,12.674297
"Hilversum, The Netherlands",5.0,"We visited the temple with our family with 2 teenagers. Truly beautiful! The complex with the temple on it is not very large. If you buy a ticket for the climb, this is standard with a guide and the tour lasts 1 hour. This is all worth it, because without a climb you will miss the most beautiful part. After the tour you still have time to walk around it on your own. You can buy tickets online, but make sure it is the official site. There are also quite a few changes in rate types and options that are not implemented on the site. Only 150 people per time slot are allowed to climb the temple per day. A total of 1200 people seems like a lot, but it fills up quickly during the European summer holidays. Staff is very helpful, so feel free to ask for help. If you do not book in advance, make sure you are at the ticket office very early in the morning.",2023-08-11,Family,2023-08,netherlands,52.2434979,5.6343227
,1.0,"Fabric with the thymus.If you have traveled a little, there you will find a very expensive temple (€31 for foreigners) and with many difficulties if you go on your own.We went by motorcycle from Yogyakarta. Once there, you could not buy a ticket for the sunrise (starting in January 2023) and we went to the new sunrise that they sell in Punthuk Setumbu (R50,000). We had clouds and nothing was seen but it wouldn't have been anything special either.After Borobudur we were at the entrance at 6:30 a.m. and we didn't have a ticket until 12:30 a.m. and bought it online!Anyway, if you have traveled a little, you will see that stopping here or in Prambanan is not essential. Countries like Sri Lanka, Cambodya or Thailand have many better Buddhist temples.",2023-08-10,Friends,2023-08,,,
"Munich, Germany",3.0,"I was there 14 years ago, and back then you could go up without any problems. Now it's different. If you're unlucky like us and didn't reserve a ticket for the climb, you can only see the temple from the outside. Including the trip from Yogyakarta, the spectacle cost us as a family around 120 euros, but without going up. Unfortunately disappointing.The temple itself is of course impressive.But a clear tip for everyone: reserve your climb in advance!!! The terrain pass is just pointless.The good thing is that the elephant enclosure has finally been closed. (Now there are a few lizards and snakes next to the playground...)",2023-08-04,Family,2023-08,germany,51.1638175,10.4478313
"Jakarta, Indonesia",2.0,"Taking special friends and family from abroad to Yogya to see Borobudur. I tried looking for tickets before going there but the website couldn't be accessed. Finally, we went to Borobudur, there was a long queue. After entering the parc & paying 375 thousand/person, but was refused to go up to Borobudur. If you want to buy tickets on the spot, you can't. Must buy online well in advance. There is no information up front that you cannot ride if you don't have an online ticket. Many tourists are disappointed. We are disappointed too!",2023-08-04,Family,2023-08,indonesia,-2.4833826,117.8902853
